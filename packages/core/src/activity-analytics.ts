 * FN-6706 requires the Signals area to read real connector pressure from the project-scoped incidents table. Use openedAt for total/open/source/severity, resolvedAt for resolved/MTTR, bucket missing source/severity as `unknown`, and degrade to an empty unavailable-MTTR shape on older schemas without incidents.
 *
 * FNXC:CommandCenterSignals 2026-06-25-23:35:
 * Connector resolution events must surface as a status breakdown, not only top-line open/resolved counts, so the UI and API can prove provider recovery signals changed incident state.
