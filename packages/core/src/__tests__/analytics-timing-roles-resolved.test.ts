FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-03:20 (batch-core feed: team-analytics 2 → 0, workflow-analytics 2 → 0, task-timing 1 → 0):

THE INVARIANT: metrics count a card's lane by its ROLE, never by its name.

All three failures produce a NUMBER, not an error, which is why they are the worst kind:

  - both analytics surfaces reported `tasksInProgress: 0` and `tasksInReview: 0` on a renamed board,
    sitting beside token and cost totals that were entirely correct. A zero next to a populated cost
    column reads as "nobody is working", not as "this metric is broken";
  - `getTotalAgentActiveMs` dropped the LIVE execution segment, so the task an agent is working on
    right now under-reported by exactly the elapsed time of the current run — and it healed itself
    the moment the card moved on and the segment was persisted into `cumulativeActiveMs`. A metric
    that is wrong only while you are watching it is close to unreportable as a bug.

All three convert onto `column-roles.ts`, whose helpers own the legacy-id degraded mode, so none of
these files carries a hand-written fallback. The no-flags cases below exercise that degraded mode and
pass either way — they are not evidence for the change, only for the compatibility claim.

REVERT PROOF, measured: restore the three literal comparisons and 4 of the 7 cases fail — two
behavioural cases in `task-timing`, plus the structural ratchet on each analytics file.

/*
The two analytics aggregators take a live SQL layer, so driving them here would mean standing up
PostgreSQL to re-assert a two-line substitution.

My first draft instead re-implemented their tally loop in the test and asserted THAT. It would have
passed with both source files reverted — it tested a copy, not the shipped code. Deleted rather than
shipped: a mirrored implementation is not coverage, it is a second place for the bug to be absent.

What replaces it is a STRUCTURAL ratchet over the real source, in the shape this repo already uses
for `engine-no-blocking-shellout`: the converted lines must call the role helpers, and the literal
comparisons must be gone. It fails on revert — verified by reverting — and it is honest about being
structural rather than behavioural. The behavioural guarantee for these two lines comes from
`column-roles.ts`'s own tests, which is the point of routing through a shared helper.
