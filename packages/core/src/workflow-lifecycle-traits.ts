FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleTraits 2026-07-19-06:10 (U6 / KTD-10):
Pure, per-IR trait→column primitives shared by the self-healing recovery sweeps.
Two concerns, both keyed on trait flags (never literal column ids) so a custom or
renamed workflow behaves correctly while builtin:coding stays byte-identical
(KTD-7: the builtin column ids ARE the legacy enum, so every predicate below
resolves to the same columns the old literals named):

  - `columnsWithFlag(ir, flag)` — the trait→columnIds expansion. A sweep resolves
    the workflow IR ONCE, expands each trait it enumerates by (wip / merge-
    orchestration / complete / archived / hold / intake) to the set of column ids
    that carry it, then filters its task snapshot by that set — no per-task IR
    resolution, no new store API (U6 architecture).

  - `resolveReboundTarget(ir)` — KTD-10 rebound target ordering: the workflow's
    `hold` column, else its `intake` column, else its first column. Self-healing's
    "requeue to backlog" rebounds target this instead of the literal "todo" so a
    custom workflow lacking a `todo` column still lands its recovered cards somewhere
    valid. For builtin:coding this resolves to `todo` (its hold column) — identical.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-21:15 (a DECLARATION is not a GUARD — I conflated them and
published the mistake, so it is written down here):

The census counts COMPARISONS against a legacy column id. It does not count a workflow DECLARING a
column with that id, and the two answer different questions:

    triage column guards in the tree            0     (no code compares against the literal)
    `triage` declared by the default lineage    yes   (builtin-coding-workflow-ir.ts:49, the intake lane)

Both are true at once. "The backlog reached zero for `triage`" means nothing in the code branches on
that NAME any more; it does not mean the column stopped existing, and a reader who takes it that way
will conclude a resolver's `?? "triage"` fallback is dead when it is the default board's actual intake
answer.

I asserted the stronger version in a review audit and it was wrong. One grep of
`builtin-coding-workflow-ir.ts` would have caught it, which is the cheap check worth doing before any
claim about what a lineage contains.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-19:20 (an EMPTY result has TWO meanings — measured, not assumed):

Everything below returns nothing for a column set that carries no traits, and there are two very
different reasons a board can look like that:

  DECLARED AND EMPTY   a v2 workflow the operator wrote that genuinely has no complete lane. "No such
                       lane" is the right answer, and a guard should act on it.

  SYNTHESIZED          a v1 graph upgraded to v2. `synthesizeDefaultColumns` (workflow-ir.ts) emits
                       `{ id, name: id, traits: [] }` for the five default ids — placement only, by
                       design, with the real trait set living in BUILTIN_CODING_WORKFLOW_IR. Those
                       columns ARE the legacy lanes; the traits were simply never expressed.

MEASURED on such an IR:
    resolveLifecycleColumns  ->  {}                      (every role undefined)
    resolveReviewColumns     ->  []
    columnsWithFlag(wip)     ->  []
    resolveTerminalColumns   ->  ["done","archived"]     (its own legacy fallback saves it)

CONSEQUENCE FOR CONVERTED GUARDS. A consumer that reads "resolved and empty" as "this board declares
no such lane" is CORRECT for the first case and WRONG for the second — on a v1-upgraded board it
withdraws every role at once. Callers that kept a `length > 0 ? resolved : legacy` guard are unaffected.

I introduced that reading deliberately in #2731/#2733/#2734 to fix the opposite bug (a legacy fallback
masking a genuinely absent lane), and it is right for hand-written v2. This note exists because it is
NOT right for the upgrade path, and the difference is invisible at the call site — both arrive here as
an empty array.

The root fix would be for the upgrade to carry the real traits rather than placeholders; that changes
behaviour for every persisted v1 workflow, so it is flagged here rather than made in passing.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-05:20 (the divergence four consumers each solved differently):
REVIEW IS A SET, AND `humanReview` COUNTS.

`resolveLifecycleColumns().review` is a SINGLE id derived from ONE flag (`mergeOrchestration`). The
domain is not that shape: a lane can host human review without orchestrating a merge, and a board may
declare more than one review lane. So every consumer asking "is this card in review" re-derived its own
answer, and they drifted:

  #2713  routes    terminal columns needed membership; fixed there only
  #2722  notifier  a `humanReview`-only lane resolved to nothing — review notifications never fired
  #2723  routes    the union was broader than core's single id
  #2728  CLI       `fn task retry` refused a card `POST /tasks/:id/retry` accepted

Four files, four patches, and a fifth site inside #2722 itself that the first pass missed. The shared
answer belongs here.

ADDITIVE ON PURPOSE. `resolveLifecycleColumns().review` is untouched, so nothing that reads it changes
behaviour — this is the missing helper, not a reshaping of the existing one. `.review` remains correct
for its own question ("which single lane does the merge gate live in"); this answers the other one
("is this card ALREADY in a review lane"), which is the question every drifting consumer was asking.

MONOTONIC, which the #2723 review round argued about: a column carrying BOTH `humanReview` and
`mergeOrchestration` is included. Adding a trait must never remove a lane from this set, or a card
stops counting as in review because its column gained an unrelated capability.
*/
/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-11:30 (a flaw in this helper as merged, found by trying to
migrate its consumers onto it):
THIS IS THE BROAD SET, AND IT IS THE WRONG ANSWER FOR STATE-CHANGING ADMISSION.

Two different questions were being answered by one name:

  BROAD   "is this card in a lane where review happens?"  -> every mergeOrchestration lane, plus every
          mergeBlocker and humanReview lane. Safe when over-admission is harmless: notifications, badges,
          read-only surfaces. This function.

  NARROW  "is this card in THE review lane the engine acts on?" -> `resolveLifecycleColumns().review` is
          `columnsWithFlag(ir, "mergeOrchestration")[0]`, ONE lane, and that is what the executor, the
          scheduler and project-engine act on. A caller that ADMITS on the broad set and then MOVES the
          card will move cards the engine does not consider in review.

`register-task-workflow-routes.ts` keeps its own narrower resolver for exactly that reason (#2723): its
re-engagement moves the card, so admitting a SECOND merge lane is a state change the engine will not
agree with. That local copy is not drift from this helper — it is the other question, and migrating it
onto this one would reintroduce the over-admission its review round reasoned away.

Stated here because the name does not carry the distinction: a future consumer reaching for "the review
columns" on a state-changing path wants the narrow form. The pair below is pinned in
`workflow-lifecycle-traits.test.ts`.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-27-09:10 (U1 / KTD-2 — workflow-owned lifecycle):
THE lifecycle-column resolution seam. ~207 production sites decide the lifecycle by
comparing `task.column` against a hardcoded id ("todo", "in-progress", …). Those guards
do not FAIL when the column moves underneath them — they silently stop matching, which
disables a recovery path with a green suite. Phases B–D convert those sites onto the two
functions below, so conversion is mechanical rather than a per-site IR plumbing exercise.

Why a single struct rather than six separate lookups: most call sites need two or three
lifecycle columns at once (a sweep gated on the hold column that rebounds into it, a
release path comparing hold against wip). Resolving them together keeps one IR read and
one cache entry per workflow.

Trait → role mapping (the trait vocabulary is the source of truth, not these names):
  intake   → `intake`             where new cards land
  hold     → `hold`               passive dwell with a release condition (capacity)
  wip      → `countsTowardWip`    occupies an implementation slot
  review   → `mergeOrchestration` the merge/PR orchestration lane
  complete → `complete`           terminal success
  archived → `archived`           globally archived

CONSERVATIVE-ON-UNRESOLVABLE (deliberate): a v1 / column-less IR resolves to `undefined`
for the WHOLE struct, not to a struct of undefined roles. The distinction matters — a
caller must be able to tell "this workflow declares no hold column" (hold: undefined,
struct present) apart from "this workflow has no column vocabulary at all" (undefined).
The first is a real workflow shape to honor; the second means the caller has no basis to
decide and must skip-and-log rather than guess a legacy literal.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-07:00 (arity contract, after two production bugs):
EACH FIELD IS **ONE** COLUMN, EVEN WHEN THE WORKFLOW DECLARES SEVERAL.

Uniqueness is validated for exactly ONE trait. `TraitRegistry.validateColumnTraits` raises
`multiple-intake-columns` when more than one column carries `intake` — and raises nothing for
`hold`, `countsTowardWip`, `mergeBlocker`, `humanReview`, `complete` or `archived`. Those may
legitimately repeat: a workflow can split `mergeBlocker` and `humanReview` across a merge lane and a
separate sign-off lane, or declare two terminal columns. `columnsWithFlag` returns an array and
`first()` below picks its head, so this struct names only one of each.

So `intake` is safe to compare by equality; every other field is not.

That makes these fields safe for ONE question and unsafe for another:

  SAFE    "where should this card GO"      — a move target must be exactly one column
  UNSAFE  "is this card ALREADY there"     — that is membership; use `columnsWithFlag(ir, flag)`
                                             and test `.includes(task.column)`

Two shipped bugs came from the unsafe use, both in PR #2713: a task in a second terminal column was
rejected with a 409, and a task in a human-review lane split from the merge lane was classified as
outside review entirely, suppressing comment re-engagement. Both read like ordinary conversions.

Known call sites comparing `task.column` against these fields:
  packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts     `columns.intake` SAFE (validated unique);
                                          `columns.hold`   AT RISK — hold has no uniqueness rule
  packages/core/src/builtin-workflows.ts  `lifecycle.intake` SAFE (validated unique)
