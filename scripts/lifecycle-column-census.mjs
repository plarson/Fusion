FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:20 (Phase C convergence):
CLI wrapper. The rules, the measured numbers that motivated them, and the reason the three
classes are reported separately live in `scripts/lib/lifecycle-column-census.mjs`; the
regression suite that pins each form this census must catch lives in
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/lifecycle-column-census.test.ts`.

Report-only by default:
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs            # human table
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --json     # machine-readable
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --compare  # cross-check AST vs text classifier
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict   # fail if any file DIVERGES from baseline
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict --update-baseline   # re-record after lowering it

`--strict` fails on a RISE (a reintroduced guard) and equally on a DROP that was not recorded: a
stale allowance is a hole through which the same guards can return while the check stays green.

WIRED INTO THE MERGE GATE (`pnpm test:gate`) as of 2026-07-31. The original note here said the
opposite — "NOT wired into the merge gate" — on the reasoning that a thousand-site backlog cannot be
blocking on the day it is first measured. That reasoning was sound and its conclusion expired: the
baseline is per-file, so gating costs nothing for files nobody touches, and while it was unwired the
baseline drifted to 854 against a tree of 787. Sixty-seven guards of regression would have merged
green (PR #2661).

Consequence for conversion PRs, stated because it is a real cost: lowering a count now REQUIRES
re-recording the baseline in the same PR (`--strict --update-baseline`). That is deliberate — it puts
the new number in the diff, where a reviewer sees it, instead of in a hand-written claim.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-06:40 (PR #2661 review — greptile, narrowed and closed):
THE DELIBERATE TOTAL IS PINNED TOO, because a marker exempts the construct it is attached to and
everything INSIDE it — so a comparison appended to an already-marked expression inherits the
exemption and never reaches the byFile counts.

Measured rather than argued, on the marker in register-task-workflow-routes.ts:
  - a comparison added as a SIBLING statement inside the same `if`  -> COUNTED (21 -> 22, fails)
  - a comparison appended to the MARKED assignment itself           -> exempt, and byFile is unchanged
The review's stated mechanism (the marker attaching to the enclosing conditional) does not hold;
the narrower hole does, and it applies to every marker in the codebase rather than just this one.

Pinning it per FILE closes it. An earlier version of this check compared the repo-wide TOTAL, which a
REMOVAL in one marked construct offsets against an ADDITION in another — the total stays flat, the
check passes, and the new guard is invisible to `byFile` too because deliberate findings are excluded
from it (PR #2661 review, greptile P1). Same high-water failure this whole PR is about, one field
over. Per-file makes offsetting edits visible, because they land in different files.

MOVED OUT OF THE `--compare` BRANCH, where it could not work in either mode.

Inside `--compare` it read `baseline`, `regressions` and `stale` — all declared
BELOW, in the `--strict` section — so the documented `--compare` command died with
`ReferenceError: Cannot access 'baseline' before initialization` before printing
anything. And `--strict` on its own never reached the block at all, so the query
ratchet it adds was enforcing nothing in the one mode that gates.

Reproduced both halves before moving it: `--compare` threw, and `--strict` ran to
completion without a single query comparison.

It belongs here, after the strict guards are declared and beside the guard ratchet
whose both-directions rule it mirrors.
