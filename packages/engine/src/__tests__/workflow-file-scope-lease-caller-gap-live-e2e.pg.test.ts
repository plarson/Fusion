FNXC:OverlapScheduling 2026-07-31-03:15 (E2E evidence — a SECOND inert-conversion mechanism, at the call site):

The previous five files in this series (#2789, #2791, #2792, #2793, #2794) all concern one mechanism:
a site resolves the workflow synchronously and silently gets the default board. This file is about a
different one, and neither the lifecycle-column census nor the sync-resolver allow-list can see it.

`shouldHoldActiveFileScopeLease` was converted by turning its two role questions into OPTIONAL
parameters with literal defaults:

    const isWipColumn    = options?.isWipColumn    ?? task.column === "in-progress";
    const isReviewColumn = options?.isReviewColumn ?? task.column === "in-review";

A caller that has resolved the column's traits passes the answer; a caller that has not gets exactly
the pre-conversion behaviour. That shape is a deliberate migration device and the source says so.

But the migration was only half made. Of the four production call sites:

    scheduler.ts:1986   passes { isWipColumn: true }        -> converted
    scheduler.ts:2006   passes { isReviewColumn: true }     -> converted
    self-healing.ts:4525  passes NEITHER                    -> still the literals
    self-healing.ts:5443  passes NEITHER                    -> still the literals

So the same predicate is right on the scheduler's path and wrong on self-healing's, and the harm is
the one the function's own FNXC note describes: on a renamed board both branches fall through, the
predicate returns false for every card, `activeScopes` stays empty, and the dispatch path sees no
overlap — two agents editing the same files, which is what the overlap machinery exists to prevent.
At the self-healing sites the consequence is narrower but the same shape: a stale-lease reconciler
concludes a live blocker holds no lease and proceeds to clear state the scheduler would have honoured.

WHY THIS IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE EXISTING INSTRUMENTS. There is no column literal at the self-healing
call sites — the literal lives inside the callee's default, one function away. A census that counts
`=== "in-progress"` occurrences sees the callee's two (correctly marked DELIBERATE-LITERAL, since for
an unconverted caller they ARE the intended behaviour) and nothing at all at the call sites. The
conversion therefore reads as complete from every angle except running it.

SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. The differential below is driven end to end: real persisted rows from a live
PostgreSQL store, the real exported predicate, both call shapes. The CALL-SITE fact — that the two
self-healing sites pass neither option — is asserted against source text, not driven through the
self-healing sweep, which would need the full dependency-lease reconcile harness. That is a real limit
and it is why the last case reads the file rather than pretending otherwise. It doubles as the alarm:
when someone converts those call sites, that case fails and points at this file.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.
