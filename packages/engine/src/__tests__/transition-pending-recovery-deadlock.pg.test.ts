/*
FNXC:PostgresCutover 2026-07-31-15:55 (regression — the startup sweep deadlocked on itself):

`recoverStaleTransitionPendingImpl` runs its whole per-task body inside `store.withTaskLock(id, ...)`.
On the PostgreSQL arm it then read the task with `store.getTask(id)` — and `getTaskImpl` opens with
`store.withTaskLock(id, ...)` too. The per-task lock is NON-REENTRANT, an invariant this codebase
states in prose in two other files ("nesting inside withTaskLock would deadlock since the lock is
non-reentrant" in `branch-and-pr-entities.ts`; "because the per-task lock is non-reentrant" in
`workflow-ops.ts`). So the sweep waited forever on a lock its own frame was holding.

SQLite never had it: that arm reads through `readTaskFromDb`, a lock-free row read. The backend port
swapped only the PostgreSQL arm to `getTask`, so the deadlock is PostgreSQL-only — which is every
production install. The fix restores a lock-free read (`readTaskRow`) on that arm.

WHY IT SURVIVED: the branch is entered only when a stale marker names a plugin hook the trait
registry still knows (`hasSurvivingPluginHook`). Three nearby cases all miss it —
  no marker at all             -> the row is not scanned
  marker with only the default -> `hasSurvivingPluginHook` is false; marker is just cleared
  marker naming an UNKNOWN hook-> reconciled away as degraded, so nothing survives to re-run
— and those are the cases the existing tests cover. Only a marker naming a REGISTERED plugin hook
reaches the read, which is precisely the state a crash mid-hook leaves behind. All four are asserted
below so the next change cannot re-narrow the path and call it covered.

FOUND BY BISECTION, not by reading. An earlier attempt to drive this recovery reported that "the
sweep never returns", which was wrong in a way worth recording: the sweep returns fine in three of
the four cases, and generalising the one hang to the whole function is what hid the actual trigger
for several sessions. The bisection is the four cases below.

EVERY CASE IS TIMEBOXED. A deadlock regression manifests as a hang, and a hung test is reported as a
suite-level timeout that names no case — useless for locating the fault. Racing each call against an
explicit deadline turns it into a normal assertion failure that names the case and the condition.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable. Throwaway per-file
database; never port 4040.

    workflow for every task under PostgreSQL. The hook runner derives its pending set from the
    columns of the IR it is given, so a task on a RENAMED board matched no plugin trait: the
    interrupted hook was never re-run and the sweep reported success having done nothing.

    Observed state, not a spy on the resolver: the hook itself records the task id it ran for. The

    carrying the plugin trait exists on this workflow and on no other.
