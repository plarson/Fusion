THE INVARIANT: a marker-only reclassification says so, instead of announcing a rise that did not
happen.

MEASURED CAUSE. `main` went red on the lifecycle ratchet TWICE in one day, from two different PRs,
and both times for the same reason: a PR added `DELIBERATE-LITERAL` markers without re-recording the
baseline. Adding a marker moves a site from `byFile` to `deliberateByFile`, so the recorded totals
shift even though unconverted debt goes **down**.

The failure text said `column-guard count ROSE`. That is the OPPOSITE of what happened, and it sent
the reader hunting for a regression that does not exist — on a red main, where the cost of a
misleading message is every other PR's Lint job.

This does not loosen the ratchet: the baseline still has to be re-recorded, and the run still exits
1. It changes what the failure TELLS you, and prints the one command that fixes it. Whether a
marker-only change should fail at all is a policy question for the ratchet's owner; making the
existing failure legible is not.

REVERT PROOF, measured: drop the reclassification branch and the message reverts to the misleading
"ROSE" wording for a marker-only diff.

    Simulate the shape that turned main red: the tree has a marker the baseline has not recorded.
    Done by REMOVING deliberate entries from a copy of the real baseline, which is exactly what a PR
    that forgot to re-record leaves behind.

    FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-20:30 (#2811 review — coderabbit):
    NOTE WHAT THIS FIXTURE ACTUALLY DOES, because the previous wording here was wrong in the same way
    the message was. Deleting only deliberate entries does NOT lower the guard count — it leaves it
    UNCHANGED. `reclassified` is `guardsNow <= guardsBefore`, so this case is the equality branch, and
    the message must therefore claim "did NOT increase" rather than a decrease. Asserting a decrease
    here would pin a second wrong number in a message whose whole job is to stop the reader chasing
    one.
