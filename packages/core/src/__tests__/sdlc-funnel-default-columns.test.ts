FNXC:SdlcFunnelColumns 2026-07-31-09:50 (the default path was the only path, and it used the legacy IR):

THE INVARIANT: the SDLC funnel's built-in column fallback maps the board Fusion actually ships.

WHAT WAS WRONG. `defaultColumns()` used `BUILTIN_CODING_WORKFLOW_IR` — the constant the catalog now
publishes as `builtin:legacy-coding`, not the current default. That would be harmless if it were only a
fallback, but the ONLY production callers use it: `aggregateActivityAnalytics` (Command Center's
`/command-center/activity`, and the OTel exporter) never passes `columns`. Its own doc comment says
callers with a custom workflow "should call `aggregateSdlcFunnel` directly" — and none do, which is what
makes this the default path rather than an edge case.

Consequence: any column id absent from the legacy set folds to OTHER, so a board whose columns differ
reads as an empty funnel while it is plainly busy. Same shape as the quick-capture default I fixed in
this branch: the explicit path was thought about, the default path was not.

WHY THESE ASSERTIONS AND NOT A SNAPSHOT. The funnel's job is that every column of the shipped board maps
to a real stage — not that a particular id list is present. Asserting the mapping is what survives the
next lineage change; asserting the id list would have to be edited by whoever makes it, which is how a
test stops being evidence and becomes a chore.

FNXC:SdlcFunnelColumns 2026-07-31-10:25 (the real fix, and the correction of my own claim):

I first changed only `defaultColumns()` from the legacy IR to `resolveDefaultWorkflowIr()` and described
it as fixing renamed boards. IT DOES NOT. Post-U11 the current lineage's column ids are a SUBSET of the
legacy constant's, so the legacy fallback already mapped everything the current one does — the change is
a consistency fix with no observable effect. The give-away was a revert proof that would not go red: my
assertions passed with the legacy constant restored.

THE REAL DEFECT is that the funnel maps by column id and folds anything it was not given into OTHER,
while the only production callers never passed `columns` at all. So a renamed or custom board's Command
Center funnel read as EMPTY while the board was plainly busy. Fixing that is a CALLER change — the route
resolves the project's own workflow columns — and these cases pin the property that makes it work.
