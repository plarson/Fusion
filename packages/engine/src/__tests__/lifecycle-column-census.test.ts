FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:35 (Phase C convergence — the census's own tests):

A census nobody has tried to fool is a number, not a measurement. This pins every form the
lifecycle-column census must catch, and every form it must NOT count — because the tracked
`=== "triage"` grep it replaces was wrong in three separate ways, and each way cost real work:

  1. it counted only ONE of six legacy column ids (triage was under 4% of the total);
  2. it missed guards whose local was named `from` / `originColumn` rather than `column`;
  3. it counted `role === "triage"` / `agentType === "triage"` — AGENT ROLE comparisons that
     must never be converted, since the planner lane keeps that name.

Each case below is one of those, plus the comment-prose case that inflated two files' counts.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-18:40 (the ratchet's one unusable state, now fixed):

`--update-baseline` MUST RUN EVEN WHEN A FILE ROSE. It could not: the rise check exited before the write,
so the only supported way to re-record was unavailable in exactly the situation that needs it.

That is a live problem, not a tidiness one, because #2654 gates CI on this AND A CONVERSION LEGITIMATELY
ADDS A LITERAL — the correct shape for a caller that may have no traits is
`flags ? flags.x : columnId === "legacy"`, and each one raises a file's count by one. Measured on main:
`columnRoles.ts` went 0 -> 1 from exactly that shape. So a worker doing the right thing met a red gate
whose only escape was hand-editing the JSON, which is how a ratchet becomes something people route around.

Exercised end to end before writing this, on a real rise injected into `live-agent-count.ts`:
  rise + plain --strict            exit 1  (unchanged — the ratchet still bites)
  rise + --strict --update-baseline exit 0, printing "ACCEPTED RISES  live-agent-count.ts: 6 -> 7"

EXIT CODES ARE THE CONTRACT and the pure summarizer cannot express them, so these assert the CLI's own
source: which branch writes, which exits, and — the part that was actually broken — the ORDER. Marker-to-
marker slices rather than character windows, and each marker checked for uniqueness first, because a
repeated marker is the magic-number problem wearing a name.

  STRIP COMMENTS — the assertions below index on marker strings, and the CLI's own prose names them.

  These two cases went red on main claiming the ORDER was inverted: `updateAt` 26374, `riseAt` 19345.
  The order in CODE is unchanged and correct (`if (updateBaseline) {` at line 487, the rise message at
  510). What moved was a COMMENT: line 359 explains the failure mode and quotes
  "column-guard count ROSE" verbatim, so `indexOf` found the prose 7000 characters before the branch
  it was meant to locate.

  A guard that a comment can invert is not measuring control flow. Worse, the honest-looking fix is to
  reword the comment, which silently re-arms the same trap for whoever explains this next.

A DROP NOW TIGHTENS THE BASELINE INSTEAD OF FAILING. Failing hard was defensible in isolation — a stale
allowance is a hole, since those guards can return up to the old count while the check stays green. What it
missed is that the drop is almost never the author's to fix: eleven files dropped during one merge wave, none
of those PRs re-recorded, and none of their authors did anything wrong.

Measured three times since CI began gating this: `columnRoles.ts` 0 -> 1, then `executor.ts` twice. A
permanently-red gate is a bigger hole than a stale allowance, because it gets ignored and then nothing is
guarded at all. The RISE check — the actual purpose — is untouched and still fails hard.

Driven end to end through the real CLI with an isolated baseline (`FUSION_CENSUS_BASELINE`), because the exit
code and the file rewrite ARE the contract and no source-level assertion can prove them. All four transitions
were exercised by hand first:
  drop, --strict            exit 0, "TIGHTENED", baseline rewritten 9 -> 6
  drop, --strict --exact    exit 1, baseline untouched
  rise, --strict            exit 1
