Original symptom: a Todo card sat on the "Queued to plan" badge while the engine had no intention of
planning it — TaskCard inferred "unplanned" from `steps.length === 0`, but triage's todo-discovery and
the scheduler's dispatch filter both decide from PROMPT.md seed-ness, so the board named the wrong cap.

These tests pin the server half: `GET /api/tasks` annotates Todo rows with `awaitingPlanning` derived
from the shared `isTaskAwaitingPlanning` predicate.

Surface enumeration (the invariant, not just the reported repro):
  - seed PROMPT.md (bootstrap stub) -> true, whatever the step count says.
  - real spec -> false, INCLUDING the reported repro shape (real spec, zero steps).
  - re-seeded card still carrying steps from a previous pass -> true (the reverse mislabel).
  - missing PROMPT.md -> true (triage regenerates the spec).
  - unreadable-for-another-reason PROMPT.md -> field omitted, so the client falls back rather than
    asserting a wrong label.
  - `needs-replan` -> true even though its PROMPT.md is a real (rejected) spec.
  - non-Todo rows -> field omitted entirely (payload stays byte-identical for them).

  THE INVARIANT: the enrichment finds the board's HOLD lane, whatever that lane is named.

  The filter named `todo`, so a workflow whose waiting lane is called anything else got no
  enrichment at all — no error, no log, just a silent fall back to the client's step-count
  heuristic, which is the exact mislabel this whole enrichment exists to correct. The card most
  likely to be wrong (real spec, zero steps) is the one that read "Queued to plan" forever.

  The store here declares `listWorkflowDefinitions`, which the harness above deliberately does not:
  every other case in this file exercises the degraded path where the legacy `todo` is all there is,
  and they must stay green — that compatibility is half the contract.

  REVERT PROOF, measured: restore `task.column === "todo"` and this case fails with
  `expected undefined to be false`, because the row is not enriched at all. Every other case in the
  file stays green.

  THE WAITING LANE IS THE `hold` ROLE, NOT THE ID `todo`.

  The enrichment filter named `todo`, so on a board whose waiting lane is called anything else NO card
  was enriched and every one of them silently fell back to TaskCard's step-count heuristic — the exact
  disagreement between badge and engine this enrichment was added to remove. It failed quietly, which
  is why it survived: the board still rendered, with badges that were merely wrong.

  A per-task workflow read was tried once and reverted for cost, on a board-load path whose own note
  warns about turning a load into thousands of reads. `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles` is one read for
  the whole board, so the objection was to the arity, not the idea.

  THE NEGATIVE MATTERS AS MUCH: widening to "enrich everything" would pass the case above and put a
  planning badge on in-progress and review cards, whose payloads are contractually byte-identical
