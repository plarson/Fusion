/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycle 2026-07-09-00:00 (FN-7717 regression):
Archiving a task must release every activeSessionRegistry entry it holds. Plan Review and
other workflow-step / step-session sessions run while a task is in triage/planning/todo (not
in-progress), so the executor's task:moved handler previously only disposed session surfaces
via the `from === "in-progress"` branch — a task archived from any OTHER column leaked its
registry entry and blocked a successor task from registering the same session path with
ActiveSessionPathHeldByForeignTaskError (NEXT-508 -> NEXT-433). This suite proves the fix
across all three registration surfaces (executor / step-session / workflow-step), the
leaked-entry sweep path (no in-memory session) including when archiving DIRECTLY from
in-progress in a single task:moved hop (a branch-ordering gap the fix also closes), the
done/in-review merge-lease exclusion, and the no-op case (task with no held paths).

  `isBackwardMoveOutOfPlanning` now receives its lanes instead of resolving them, and its own suite
  (`executor-planner-lanes-resolved`) covers the predicate thoroughly. But that suite calls the
  predicate DIRECTLY, so it says nothing about whether the `task:moved` listener actually hands the
  payload down. Measured: replacing the listener's `lanes` argument with `undefined` left
  `planning-evacuation` at 20/20 green — the exact producer/consumer split this program's learnings
  record as its fifth failure shape, where a converted consumer with an unconverted producer passes
  every instrument.

  So this drives the real listener. The board is renamed with NO legacy id anywhere near the planner
  lanes (`queued` holds, `drafting` intakes), and the move withdraws a card from the hold lane to a
  non-lifecycle column — the reported symptom, `todo -> Ideas`, in this board's vocabulary. The
  evacuation must fire, which it can only do if the payload lanes reached the predicate: with
  `undefined` the legacy pair answers, `from` is not `todo`/`triage`, and the branch declines.

THE SAME RELEASE, ON A BOARD THAT DOES NOT CALL ITS ARCHIVE LANE `archived`.

The branch above was keyed on the `archived` literal, so on a renamed board the archive transition
fell through to the narrower `from === wip` arm — or to no arm at all — and the registry entry leaked
exactly as it did before FN-7717, for the same downstream cost: a successor task cannot acquire the
same session path.

#3109 made `task:moved` carry the emitter-resolved lanes, so the guard reads the answer off the
payload with NO await. That matters here specifically: this listener's disposal bookkeeping is written
in the handler's own tick and read by the NEXT event's prologue (the FN-5256 fast-bounce path), so a
guard that had to await could not be used without reopening that race.

The paired negative is the load-bearing half. `done`/`in-review` deliberately keep their merge leases
across the transition (FN-6736 / Phase C-D), so a resolved-lane guard must not start releasing them —
a conversion that released on every terminal-ish lane would satisfy the positive and break the
guarantee this file already protects.
