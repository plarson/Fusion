FNXC:WorkflowScheduling 2026-07-31-07:10 (E2E evidence — the optional-role-parameter class, third instance):

Third measured instance of the pattern from #2795 and #2798, and the sharpest form of it: the
converted and unconverted call sites are in the SAME FILE, and one is nested inside the other's call
tree.

`in-process-runtime.ts` resolves terminal columns through an optional parameter defaulting to the
legacy pair (`done` + `archived`). Three internal call sites:

  drainDuePlanningContinuations:386        passes { terminalColumns }              CONVERTED
  selectActionablePlanningContinuations:413 passes NOTHING                         unconverted
  resolvePlanningContinuationCandidate:199  calls the inner dispatchable predicate
                                            without threading its own set          unconverted

WHAT BREAKS. `selectActionablePlanningContinuations` documents its own purpose as excluding
"soft-deleted / archived / done tasks so archive-fallback rows returned by getTask cannot re-enter
plan-review after the card left the board". On a renamed board its terminal check is against ids that
board does not have, so a card sitting in its COMPLETE column is classified `actionable` and re-enters
plan-review — precisely the thing the function exists to prevent, silently, on every custom board.

The third site is subtler and worth naming because it shows the conversion is not even whole along
the converted path: `resolvePlanningContinuationCandidate` applies the caller's resolved set to its
own terminal test, then delegates to `isPlanningContinuationTaskDispatchable(task)` WITHOUT passing
it, so that inner predicate re-tests against the legacy pair. A partially threaded conversion is
indistinguishable from a complete one at every call site that looks converted.

WHY THE CENSUS CANNOT SEE ANY OF IT. There is no column literal at the unconverted call sites — the
literal is `LEGACY_TERMINAL_PAIR`, one function away, where it is correct for an unconverted caller
and correctly annotated. Same mechanism as #2795 and #2798; this file adds the intra-file variant.

SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. The behavioural cases are driven end to end with real persisted rows from a
live PostgreSQL store and the real exported functions. The call-site split is asserted against the
runtime module's SYNTAX (parsed, not string-matched — see the note on that case) because driving the
drain needs the runtime's full dependency set, which I did not build; the audit case says so rather
than dressing it up.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.

    AST, not string splitting. The first version found call sites by splitting on the callee name and
    then reasoning about the text that followed — whitespace, the next `;`, whether the slice started
    with a parameter name. A formatting-only change to the runtime could fail this suite or, worse,
    silently misclassify a site, which is the failure mode this whole series is about. Matching the
    repo's existing precedent for the same problem (`core/.../sync-workflow-ir-callsite-allowlist.test.ts`),
    the check now parses the module and inspects real call expressions and their argument lists, so
    it depends on the code's structure rather than its layout.

    An alarm in both directions, like #2798's: converting the remaining site fails this case, which
    is the moment to read the three behavioural cases above and update it deliberately.
