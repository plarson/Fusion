/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-00:40 (fleet phase — why `async-comments-attachments.ts` was NOT converted):
THE ARCHIVED GATE IS ENFORCED IN THREE ENCODINGS, AND CONVERTING ONE OF THEM IS A SPLIT BRAIN.

Every other file in the column-literal backlog can be converted on its own: resolve the task's
lifecycle columns, compare against the role. `archived` is different, and the difference is not a
matter of degree.

MEASURED on this tree — THREE encodings, 50 sites, all in packages/core:
  - 35 TypeScript comparisons against the literal `"archived"` across 23 files.

  (Was 37 when this guard landed. Two dropped as conversions merged — `agent-store.ts`'s claim guard in
  #2746 and one in `update-task-deps.ts` — and the guard FAILED until this inventory was updated to match,
  which is the ratchet working: it notices the TypeScript half moving in either direction, not only up.)
  - 7 Drizzle predicates pushing the same rule into SQL as `ne(tasks.column, 'archived')`, in 6 files.
  - 8 RAW `sql` template comparisons (`sql`${tasks.column} != 'archived'`` and one hand-written
    `SELECT ... "column" = 'archived'`), in 5 files.

I expected two halves and asserted the third was empty. It was not: the raw-template scan came back
with five files on the first run. That is the strongest argument in this file — a partial conversion
does not have to miss one encoding, it can miss two, and nothing in the codebase is counting them.

The SQL halves decide which rows a query RETURNS. The TypeScript half decides what the code does with
a row it already has. All three are encodings of one sentence: "an archived task is not live."

Convert only the TypeScript half and a board whose archived lane is renamed splits:
`getLiveTaskColumn` correctly reports the task archived (it resolved the role), while
`readLiveTaskRows` still hands that task back as live (its SQL still compares the string). A document
write is then rejected by one gate and its parent listed by the other — a state neither gate alone can
produce today, and one that no test would catch, because every builtin workflow spells the column
`archived` so the two halves agree by accident on every board we ship.

WHY THE SQL HALVES CANNOT JUST BE CONVERTED TOO. `ne(tasks.column, ...)` needs the resolved id as a
VALUE at query-build time, so the workflow IR must be resolved BEFORE the query — including inside
`for update` transactions in the document/artifact paths, which currently take no store and no
workflow reader (they receive a `db`/`tx` handle and a task id). Threading a resolver into the
persistence layer, or declaring `archived` a non-renameable system column and marking all 52 sites
deliberate, are both real decisions with real blast radius. Neither is a fleet conversion. The raw
templates are worse again: one of them is a hand-written `SELECT` string, so its comparison is not even
a Drizzle expression that could take a bound value without rewriting the query.

SO THIS FILE IS THE GUARD, NOT THE FIX. It fails when any of the three encodings stops matching its
audited inventory below — which is exactly what a well-intentioned partial conversion does.

REVERT CHECK, measured. Converting the `archived` comparisons in `async-comments-attachments.ts` (the
shape a conversion PR would produce) drops its audited count from 8 and fails the lockstep case with the
split-brain message. Removing one Drizzle predicate and removing one raw template each fail it from
their own side. All three were run.
