/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-22:20 (Phase C convergence — AST classifier):

WHY AN AST AND NOT A REGEX. Three people measured the remaining lifecycle-column work with three
greps and got three answers (6, 8, 12 role-bucket sites). A regex cannot tell a lifecycle-column
comparison from an agent role, a session purpose, a surface name, a step status, or a comment — so
no grep-derived number is authoritative, however careful the pattern. This module parses instead.

WHAT THE PARSER BUYS, concretely, over the text census next to it:
  - comments are not tokens, so prose about an old guard cannot be counted (the text version needed
    a comment stripper, and a bug in that stripper let ONE marker launder FOUR live guards);
  - the receiver is a real expression, so `t.column`, `live?.column`, `String(task.status)` and
    `tasks[i].column` all resolve without a hand-tuned pattern per shape;
  - sibling comparisons are found by walking the ENCLOSING expression rather than a line window, so
    a multi-line `||` chain is one unit and an unrelated line four rows away is not.

WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO, stated plainly rather than implied: without a full type-checker program it
cannot prove a receiver is column-typed. So classification remains evidence-based — the receiver's
name plus the vocabulary its siblings use — and the three non-column classes are reported
SEPARATELY rather than netted, so a wrong classification is visible instead of silently changing
the bar. Two independent implementations agreeing on 12 role sites is the strongest evidence
available; one number from one grep is the weakest.

CLASSES (only the first is backlog):
  column      — a lifecycle-column guard.
  role        — AgentRole / session purpose / surface. Converting one is a real bug: the planner
                LANE is named `triage` and keeps that name; U11 removed the COLUMN.
  status      — StepStatus / mission / goal / feature status. `done`, `in-progress` and `archived`
                collide with column ids; `pending` and `skipped` never do.
  deliberate  — reviewed literal carrying a DELIBERATE-LITERAL marker in its leading comments.

  happens to share a word with a column id.

  This is not a preference: the shipped classifier counted it, the pinned baseline did not, and that

  So the baseline was recorded by a classifier that excluded it, and the exclusion was lost before

  pin to match a miscount — which would have quietly conceded a guard that does not exist.

  Deliberately extending the VALUE vocabulary rather than the receiver-name list, because names are
  unreliable here and provably so: `state` looked like the same class but holds
  `await getLiveTaskColumn(...)` — a real column, correctly counted. A name rule would have deleted
  that guard from the backlog. The sibling signal is the mechanism that already caught
  `sessionPurpose` and `surface`.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-29-19:20 (query-filter category):

A guard is not the only way a legacy column id decides behaviour. `listTasks({ column: "todo" })`
is a SOURCE QUERY: it selects the rows a sweep will consider, and on a board that renamed or merged
that column it returns nothing — so a sweep whose per-task predicate was correctly converted still
does nothing, and looks converted while being dead. `self-healing.ts:2849` names the pairing in
prose, and #2560 had to repair exactly that combination after a converted predicate was left with a
literal query. One measured consequence: `recoverStuckMergeDeadlocks` cannot see a renamed board at
all (proven on a live store: the renamed rows exist and none appear in its three-literal union).

The comparison walk cannot see these — a PropertyAssignment is not a BinaryExpression — so they
were invisible to the census and to its ratchet, meaning the class could grow silently.

COUNTED SEPARATELY, deliberately. `totals.column` and the per-column/per-file backlog are left
byte-identical, so the completion bar ("triage guards to 0") keeps its existing meaning and the
pinned baseline does not move. This adds a second, independently pinned number.

DEFINITIONS ARE NOT QUERIES. Workflow IR graph nodes carry `column:` to declare where a node lives
(`{ id: "review", kind: "...", column: "in-review" }`), which is the lineage DEFINING itself — the
builtin IR files hold ~32 of these. Converting one would be nonsense. They are told apart
structurally rather than by filename: a definition's object literal also carries `id:` or `kind:`,
a query's does not.
