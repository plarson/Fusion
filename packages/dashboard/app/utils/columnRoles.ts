FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8 drift conversion):
ONE place that answers "what ROLE does this column play?" when trait metadata may be
missing, replacing three copy-pasted id fallbacks in ListView.

WHY A HELPER AND NOT A BARE TRAIT READ. Trait flags come from the resolved workflow, so
`columnFlagsById` legitimately has no entry in two states:

  1. the pre-load window — the board renders before the workflows fetch resolves;
  2. a stranded card resting in a column its workflow no longer declares.

A bare `flags.intake === true` returns false in both, which is silent degradation rather
than a visible failure: the Planning badge just stops appearing, and a move back into a
pre-implementation lane stops asking whether to preserve step progress — so an operator
loses completed steps with no prompt and no error. That is why the fallback exists and
why deleting it is not the cleanup it looks like.

What was wrong was having the fallback THREE TIMES, inline, as `column === "todo" ||
column === "triage"`. Copies drift, none of them were reachable from a test, and each
read like a lifecycle rule rather than the degraded mode it is. Here it is named, has one
definition, and is covered — including the degraded path itself, which is the part that
never had a test.
