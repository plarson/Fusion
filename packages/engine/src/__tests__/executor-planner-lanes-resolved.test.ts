/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-09:55 (Phase C convergence — executor.ts):

TWO EXECUTOR DECISIONS THAT NAMED THE DEFAULT LINEAGE'S COLUMNS, and what each one
silently stopped doing on a renamed board:

  1. STRANDED-COMPLETED RECOVERY (`recoverCompletedTask`). `promotedFromPlannerColumn` was
     `originColumn === "todo" || === "triage"`. On a renamed board it was false, so
     finished work resting in the planning lane was not promoted — the code fell through to
     `handoffTaskToReview` straight from the planning column, and role adjacency has no
     planning -> review edge, so the handoff was rejected and the card stayed stranded with
     its work complete. This is the recovery of LAST RESORT; a literal here means the last
     resort does not exist off the default lineage.

  2. PLANNING EVACUATION (the `task:moved` branch). `from === "todo" || === "triage"`
     decided whether a card had been pulled BACKWARD out of a lane where pre-execution graph
     work runs. On a renamed board a withdrawn card kept its reviewer streaming and its
     pre-execution worktree on disk.

THE PROMOTION TARGET IS CONVERTED TOO, deliberately. Resolving the planner lane and then
moving to a literal `in-progress` is the half-conversion this program has already been
burned by twice: the guard starts admitting cards on a renamed board and the move then
sends them to a column that board does not declare — strictly worse than refusing, because
the refusal was at least visible.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-17:05 (PR #2628 review — greptile P1 x2):

Both findings are over-reaches in my own first version, and the first one made the branch WORSE
than the bug it replaced. Recording that plainly because it is the third time this program has
produced the same shape: role-aware gate, name-matched destinations.

  1. FORWARD MOVES TRIGGERED EVACUATION. The evacuation branch's source check became role-aware
     while its destination exclusions stayed literal, so on a renamed board an ordinary forward
     move (planning -> building) passed the source test and matched no exclusion. The evacuation
     fired on a card that was simply advancing: live planning work aborted, valid pre-execution
     worktree deleted. Before the conversion the source check failed and nothing happened — so a
     half-conversion turned a missed rescue into active damage.

  2. A MISSING WIP ROLE INVENTED A COLUMN. `resolvePlannerLanes` substituted the legacy
     `in-progress` when a workflow declared no WIP role, so the promotion targeted a column that
     board does not declare. `moveTask` rejects it, recovery reports failure — and since the
     intake -> hold re-home runs FIRST, the card could be left half-moved. Now `wip`/`review`/
     `complete` are OPTIONAL when the workflow speaks columns, and the caller refuses BEFORE any
     move.
