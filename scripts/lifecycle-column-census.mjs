FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-14:20 (Phase C convergence):
CLI wrapper. The rules, the measured numbers that motivated them, and the reason the three
classes are reported separately live in `scripts/lib/lifecycle-column-census.mjs`; the
regression suite that pins each form this census must catch lives in
`packages/engine/src/__tests__/lifecycle-column-census.test.ts`.

Report-only by default:
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs            # human table
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --json     # machine-readable
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --compare  # cross-check AST vs text classifier
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict   # fail if any file DIVERGES from baseline
  node scripts/lifecycle-column-census.mjs --strict --update-baseline   # re-record after lowering it

`--strict` fails on a RISE (a reintroduced guard) and equally on a DROP that was not recorded: a
stale allowance is a hole through which the same guards can return while the check stays green.

WIRED INTO THE MERGE GATE (`pnpm test:gate`) as of 2026-07-31. The original note here said the
opposite — "NOT wired into the merge gate" — on the reasoning that a thousand-site backlog cannot be
blocking on the day it is first measured. That reasoning was sound and its conclusion expired: the
baseline is per-file, so gating costs nothing for files nobody touches, and while it was unwired the
baseline drifted to 854 against a tree of 787. Sixty-seven guards of regression would have merged
green (PR #2661).

Consequence for conversion PRs, stated because it is a real cost: lowering a count now REQUIRES
re-recording the baseline in the same PR (`--strict --update-baseline`). That is deliberate — it puts
the new number in the diff, where a reviewer sees it, instead of in a hand-written claim.

MIXED VOCABULARY IS THE FLEET'S DOMINANT DEFECT. Four review findings in one day were the same
shape: a guard converted to role resolution while the function it FEEDS still filters on the
literal. The resolved guard admits a custom column, the literal collaborator then rejects it, and
nothing errors — the endpoint just returns "repaired: 0" and looks converted.

A file where both vocabularies are live is where that can happen, so this reports them. It is a

phase, and this is deliberately report-only for that reason. What it buys is that a reviewer of a
file on this list knows to check the collaborators of anything converted, which is what the repo's
Surface Enumeration rule already asks for and what these four PRs each missed.

everything INSIDE it — so a comparison appended to an already-marked expression inherits the
exemption and never reaches the byFile counts.

Measured rather than argued, on the marker in register-task-workflow-routes.ts:
  - a comparison added as a SIBLING statement inside the same `if`  -> COUNTED (21 -> 22, fails)
  - a comparison appended to the MARKED assignment itself           -> exempt, and byFile is unchanged
The review's stated mechanism (the marker attaching to the enclosing conditional) does not hold;
the narrower hole does, and it applies to every marker in the codebase rather than just this one.

Pinning it per FILE closes it. An earlier version of this check compared the repo-wide TOTAL, which a
REMOVAL in one marked construct offsets against an ADDITION in another — the total stays flat, the
check passes, and the new guard is invisible to `byFile` too because deliberate findings are excluded
from it (PR #2661 review, greptile P1). Same high-water failure this whole PR is about, one field

only supported way to re-record was unavailable in exactly the situation that needs it.

That is not hypothetical now that #2654 gates CI on this. A CONVERSION LEGITIMATELY ADDS A LITERAL: the
correct shape for a caller that may have no traits is `flags ? flags.x : columnId === "legacy"`, and every
one of those raises a file's count by one. So a worker doing the right thing hits a red gate whose only
escape is hand-editing the JSON — which is how a ratchet becomes something people route around instead of
run. Measured on current main: `columnRoles.ts` 0 -> 1 from exactly that shape.

The flag is an explicit operator action, so it re-records unconditionally and PRINTS what it accepted
under `ACCEPTED RISES`. Silently swallowing a rise is the real danger; refusing to let anyone re-record is
the same danger one step later, wearing a red check nobody trusts.

  A DROP TIGHTENS THE BASELINE INSTEAD OF FAILING. The old behaviour failed hard, and the reasoning was sound
  in isolation — a stale allowance is a hole, since those guards can return up to the old count while the
  check stays green. What it missed is that the drop is almost never the author's to fix: eleven files dropped
  during one merge wave, none of those PRs re-recorded, and none of their authors did anything wrong. Measured
  three separate times since CI began gating this (`columnRoles.ts` 0->1, then `executor.ts` twice).

  A PERMANENTLY-RED GATE IS A BIGGER HOLE THAN A STALE ALLOWANCE, because it gets ignored and then nothing is
  guarded at all. So the ceiling now follows the count down automatically and says so, while the RISE check —
  the actual purpose, "no new guards" — still fails hard and untouched.

  THE RESIDUAL, named rather than glossed: in CI the write is discarded with the runner, so the committed
  baseline stays stale until someone commits a tightened one. The exposure is bounded (regrowth only up to the
  old count) and printed on every run, and it is strictly smaller than the exposure from a check people route
  around. `--exact` keeps hard failure for the end state, when the count is meant to be pinned and any
  divergence is a real event.

  A TOUCHED FILE MUST BE RE-RECORDED; AN UNTOUCHED ONE IS AUTO-TIGHTENED.

  The residual named below is real: in CI the tightening write is discarded with the runner, so the
  committed allowance stays stale and a later change can regrow guards up to it while the gate is
  green. Naming that is not closing it.

  This closes it where the regrowth would have to happen. Regrowing a guard means EDITING the file,
  so requiring an exact baseline only for files the change TOUCHES makes the hole unreachable — while
  the case this PR exists for stays green, because those authors did not touch the files that dropped
  (eleven files dropped in one merge wave; none of those authors did anything wrong).

  Falls back to the lenient path when no base ref resolves, so a detached or shallow checkout
  degrades to the previous behaviour rather than failing closed on a git detail.
