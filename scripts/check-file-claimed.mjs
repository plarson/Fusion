FNXC:FleetCoordination 2026-07-31-06:10 (fleet):

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every fleet worker pushes as the SAME GitHub account, so `gh pr list --author "@me"`
returns all 17 open PRs and no worker can tell their own from a teammate's. There is no way to ask "is
this file already being converted?" short of fetching every open PR's file list by hand — 25+ API calls
that a worker will not make before starting, and I did not make either.

MEASURED COST, not a hypothetical: four of my PRs were superseded by teammates landing the same work
first (#3096, #3116, #3140 shrank to tests; #3125 to nothing and was closed). In every case both
implementations were correct and independently reached the same design. The fleet is not making
mistakes — it is doing correct work twice, and finding coverage gaps only by accident when the rebases
collide.

WHAT THIS DOES. One command, one answer:

    node scripts/check-file-claimed.mjs packages/engine/src/self-healing.ts

It prints the open PRs touching that path, so "claimed?" is answerable before the work starts rather
than at rebase time.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, deliberately. It cannot see work that is in progress and unpushed, so it narrows
the window rather than closing it. Closing it needs distinguishable authorship — a per-worker
`Co-Authored-By` or a title prefix — which is a coordination decision, not a script. This is the part
that can be fixed from inside the repo.

FNXC:FleetClaims 2026-07-31-21:10 (#3175 review — coderabbitai, "detect or eliminate truncation"):
A SILENT CAP TURNS THIS TOOL INTO THE BUG IT PREVENTS.

`--limit 100` returns at most 100 PRs. Past that, claims live in PRs this never sees and a claimed file
reports UNCLAIMED — the one answer that must never be wrong here, because a worker acts on it by
starting work someone else already started. This fleet ran 50+ open PRs at once, so the cap is not
hypothetical.

Fails closed rather than warning: a warning printed above an `UNCLAIMED` line is read as noise next to
a verdict. Same reasoning as `gh()` exiting rather than returning empty.
