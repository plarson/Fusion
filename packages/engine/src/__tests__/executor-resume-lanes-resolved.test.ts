/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-21:10 (Phase C convergence — resume eligibility):

THE INVARIANT: the columns a paused-node RESUME may start from are the task's own hold, wip and
review lanes.

Four literal comparisons decided that one question and had to agree with each other:
`preservedInReview`, the audit `mode` label, the resume-safety recheck inside the retry callback,
and the branch choosing `execute()` versus `executeWorkflowGraph()`. On a renamed board
`preservedInReview` was false for a card sitting in review AND the recheck rejected it, so the
paused-node re-entry silently never happened — an engine pause/resume left the card parked with
nothing to resume it.

OFF THE `triage` BAR, deliberately: these are `in-review`/`in-progress`/`todo` guards. Same defect
class, different literals; recorded here so the next sweep of that class has a worked example and a
shared resolver to reuse.
