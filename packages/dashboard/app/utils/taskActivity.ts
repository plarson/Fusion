  The task's own column traits, when the caller has them. Fresh-planner-activity was

  `todo`, `triage` deleted — a planning card with live planner logs stops reading as
  agent-active. That is not one badge: this predicate drives the pulsing status badge,
  the agent-active row border, and the column header's executing count, so the whole
  board would quietly report planning work as idle.

  Optional, and the legacy ids remain the fallback: callers without resolved metadata

FNXC:TaskActivity 2026-07-16-00:00:
FN-8055 makes the agent-active border and pulsing badges represent the same ground truth: an agent is working now. Reject render-context global pause, queue, and derived freshness-stuck gates before checking activity, then combine the engine's column-aware active window with canonical phase statuses and the running unified workflow item that drives progress badges.

FNXC:TaskActivity 2026-07-28-12:00:
FN-8300 also honors a bounded, client-only fresh planner-log timestamp for triage cards. The log stream can arrive before the authoritative planning-status row; this render-only fallback closes that window without changing routing/model locks.

FNXC:TaskActivity 2026-07-22-09:25:
FN-8494 requires cards parked in the engine's durable `needs-replan` planning stage to keep their activity chrome on both triage and plan-in-place todo lanes. This is rendering-only: do not add `needs-replan` to ACTIVE_STATUSES, because model and routing pickers use that set as a long-lived lock policy while this predicate only describes live operator chrome. Extend the bounded fresh-log window to the todo replan lane so an incoming planner log remains represented consistently there.

Stuck-killed and both terminal columns are never active, even when stale execution status or workflow-step data remains on the task.

Model-resolution and routing locks intentionally import only ACTIVE_STATUSES and retain their status-or-in-progress policy; using this rendering predicate there would change lock behavior during status-null workflow steps.
