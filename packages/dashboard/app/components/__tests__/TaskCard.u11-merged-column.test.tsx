/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-29-00:00 (U12 — R8 drift conversion):
TaskCard's planning affordances under the U11 COLUMN SHAPE, where the merged
pre-implementation column keeps the id `todo` and `triage` no longer exists.

This is the shape that made the drift urgent. Every affordance here used to be gated on
`task.column === "triage"`. Land U11's IR on top of that and each comparison silently
becomes false: the delete button, the awaiting-approval controls, the planner badge and
the step list all disappear from planning cards — a green merge and a broken board.

The cards below therefore declare NO legacy id anywhere. They sit in `todo`, carrying the
merged column's traits (intake + hold), which is exactly what a post-U11 board hands the
component.

REVERT CHECK: restore any `task.column === "triage"` comparison and the matching case
fails, because these cards are not in `triage` and never will be again.

  `columnFlags` threading the badge did not render at all, yet the case passed because
  other "Planning" text is present on the card. Same mistake I made in the ListView DOM
  test — matching a word that also appears in chrome.
