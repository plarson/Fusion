/**
 * FNXC:TaskRevert 2026-07-04-00:00:
 * FN-7524 stamps an AI-undo task with `sourceMetadata.revertOf = <sourceTaskId>`
 * (see `REVERT_OF_METADATA_KEY` in `packages/engine/src/task-revert.ts`) — this is
 * the sole authoritative undo→source pointer written by `createAiUndoTask`. The
 * backend deliberately does NOT set `sourceParentTaskId` for undo tasks (that field
 * is owned by refine/duplicate lineage and child-task counting), so this helper only
 * falls back to `sourceParentTaskId` defensively for forward-compatibility with a
 * future backend shape; today it always resolves via `revertOf`.
 *
 * The `sourceParentTaskId` fallback is gated to `sourceType === "recovery"` (the
 * sourceType `createAiUndoTask` stamps). `task_refine`/`task_duplicate` tasks also
 * set `sourceParentTaskId`, but for an UNRELATED lineage relationship that already
 * renders its own "Created via Refinement/Duplicate of <id>" provenance clause
 * (`getProvenanceLabel` in TaskDetailModal.tsx) — without this gate, an undo-of
 * clause would double-render alongside it for the same id.
 *
 * FN-7555 (this task) surfaces this marker bi-directionally in the dashboard only —
 * no new API, no backend changes. Both `TaskCard` and `TaskDetailModal` import this
 * helper (and `findOpenUndoTaskForSource` below) so the forward/reverse affordances
 * never disagree about what counts as "an undo relationship".

    STILL A LITERAL, deliberately, and left counted.

    I converted this and added a `columnFlags` parameter — SINCE REMOVED, so this function takes only
    `(tasks, sourceTaskId)` today. Its only caller is TaskDetailModal ~line
    926, which sits ~60 lines ABOVE where `detailColumnFlags` is derived, so it could not supply one.
    The parameter was therefore never passed: the guard was gone, the census counted a conversion,
    and the behaviour was the legacy fallback forever.

    Reverted rather than left as a dead seam. An unsupplied optional parameter is strictly worse than
    the literal — the literal is at least honest, and the census keeps pointing here. Unblocking it
    means hoisting the flags derivation above that call, which is a hook-ordering change in a
    5000-line component (same blocker as the near-duplicate gate in that file).
