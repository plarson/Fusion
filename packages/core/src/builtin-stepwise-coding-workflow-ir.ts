/**
 * The built-in **stepwise** coding workflow (KTD-9) — the demonstration of step
 * inversion and the parity-comparison subject for the engine's
 * `stepwise-workflow-parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * Unlike the default `builtin-coding-workflow-ir` (which keeps a single monolithic
 * `execute` seam and is the byte-identity parity oracle, KTD-1), this workflow
 * models per-step policy explicitly as graph structure:
 *
 *   plan seam
 *     → parse-steps(PROMPT.md, step-headings)        (KTD-12: graph-native parse)
 *     → foreach(task-steps, sequential, shared) {     (KTD-3: runtime expansion)
 *         step-execute                                 (KTD-2: run one step)
 *           → step-review(code):                       (KTD-4: verdicts as edges)
 *               approve  → step-done (template exit)    (APPROVE auto-completes)
 *               revise   → rework back to step-execute (revise in place, no reset)
 *               rethink  → rework back to step-execute (reset semantics handler-side)
 *               unavailable → (advisory) routes onward
 *       }
 *       rework-exhausted → hold(manual)                (KTD-5: bounded escalation)
 *     → review seam
 *     → merge seam
 *
 * The columns/traits are identical to the default builtin so the full lifecycle
 * (merge-blocker, human review, capacity, hold, complete, archived) behaves
 * exactly as it does for the default workflow — only the in-progress step
 * modeling differs.
 *
 * It declares its step-source artifact (KTD-12): PROMPT.md produced by the
 * planning seam. The IR is v2-only (foreach/step-review/parse-steps are v2 node
 * kinds), so `downgradeIrToV1IfPure` refuses it and the flag-OFF rollback contract
 * (KTD-8) is preserved automatically.
