FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-05:40 (E2E evidence — the optional-role-parameter class, measured):

#2795 found one instance of a conversion pattern the lifecycle-column census cannot see: a role
question migrated into an OPTIONAL parameter whose default is the legacy literal, converted at some
call sites and not others. This file shows it is not a one-off, and measures it.

THE PATTERN. The callee is converted and its default is correctly marked DELIBERATE-LITERAL, because
for an unconverted caller that default IS the intended behaviour. The unconverted CALL SITES contain
no column literal at all — the literal lives one function away. So the census counts the callee's
literals (correctly annotated) and sees nothing at the call sites, and the conversion reads as
complete from every angle except running it.

TWO MEASURED SEAMS:

  shouldHoldActiveFileScopeLease   4 of 4 call sites pass the resolved answer   (#2795, closed by #2975)
  evaluateParkedAgentTaskLink      2 of 6 call sites pass the resolved answer   (this file)

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-23:30 (first seam CLOSED; number updated deliberately):
The lease seam was 2-of-4 when measured. #2975 converted both self-healing sites, this counter failed
on the advance that landed it, and the number below moved on purpose — which is the whole reason the
audit asserts an exact count instead of a floor. The parked-link seam is UNCHANGED at 2-of-6, so the
class this file exists to measure is not closed; one of its two instances is.

The second is the more damaging. Its own FNXC note states the consequence exactly: without the
resolved columns "the card would be treated as unparked and its live agent link cleared" — a
stale-link bug turned into a DROPPED-link bug. The four unconverted callers are the two in
`agent-heartbeat.ts` and the two in `self-healing.ts`; the converted two are in `scheduler.ts` and
`task-agent-sync.ts` itself.

SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY. The behavioural differential is driven end to end: real persisted rows from a
live PostgreSQL store, the real exported predicate, both call shapes. The CALL-SITE SPLIT is asserted
against source text, not driven through the heartbeat and self-healing sweeps — reaching all six
sites needs harnesses I did not build. The audit case says so in its own comment. Its job is to be an
alarm and a counter: it fails when a new unconverted caller appears AND when someone converts an
existing one, so the number cannot drift silently in either direction.

LANE. `.pg.test.ts`, skipped via `pgDescribe` when no PostgreSQL is reachable, so the merge gate is
unaffected. Throwaway per-file database; never port 4040.
