/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-23:20 (Phase C convergence — the AST classifier's tests):

WHY A PARSER AT ALL. Three people measured this backlog with three greps and got three different
answers for the role bucket (6, 8, 12). A regex cannot tell a lifecycle-column comparison from an
agent role, a session purpose, a surface name, a step status, or a comment — so no grep-derived
number is authoritative, however careful the pattern.

These cases are the four reintroduction shapes a ratchet must catch (double-quoted, single-quoted,
multiline, deeper-qualified) plus the shapes it must NOT flag. A guard nobody has tried to fool is
a number, not a measurement.

The parser and the text classifier are kept as two independent implementations on purpose: the CLI's
`--compare` asserts the parser is a strict SUPERSET of the regex (measured +6, all real), and fails
if the regex ever finds something the parser misses — which would mean the parser has a blind spot
and its count cannot be the bar.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-29-20:10 (query-filter category):

A guard is not the only way a legacy column id decides behaviour. `listTasks({ column: "todo" })`
is a SOURCE QUERY — it selects the rows a sweep considers at all — so on a board that renamed or
merged that column it returns nothing, and a sweep whose per-task predicate WAS correctly converted
still does nothing while looking converted. `self-healing.ts:2849` names the pairing in prose and
#2560 had to repair exactly that combination.

The comparison walk cannot see these: a PropertyAssignment is not a BinaryExpression. So they were
invisible to both the census and its ratchet, and the class could grow silently.

These cases pin the three decisions that make the category meaningful: it is counted, it is counted
SEPARATELY from the backlog, and an IR node definition is not mistaken for a query.

sites, the baseline recorded by the SAME PR did not, and that gap kept `--strict` RED on main from
