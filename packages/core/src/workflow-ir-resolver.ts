FNXC:WorkflowIrPin 2026-07-18-20:20:
KTD-3 — a task pins its resolved workflow IR when it ENTERS a node, and holds
that resolution until the node settles. The pin is a durable seam: the field
lives on the workflow run state (schema wiring lands in U9; this is the in-code
seam U1 adds now). Restart recovery compares the stored pin against the CURRENT
IR and takes the drift-park path on mismatch — the pin survives crashes.

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` is otherwise live-per-call, so a mid-flight editor
edit that changes the graph under a running task is a determinism hole; the pin
plus `detectWorkflowDrift` closes it. If an edit deleted the pinned node or its
column, the task parks with `task:reconcile-workflow-drift` instead of traversing
a mutated graph.

FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-12:10 (lifecycle-column census enabler):
WHY PROVENANCE IS A SEPARATE ANSWER FROM THE IR.

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` answers "which workflow governs this task" by returning the default
coding IR in two cases that are NOT the same as knowing: the selection read threw, and the store
reported no selection at all (the synchronous PostgreSQL path does exactly that). Callers cannot
tell those apart from a genuine selection, and for lifecycle-column work the difference decides
correctness rather than tidiness.

Concretely, and this is what motivated it: post-merge the default coding lineage declares `todo`
as its single Planning column and NO `triage`. So a call site converting a `column === "triage"`
guard to trait resolution silently stops firing for `builtin:legacy-coding` cards whenever the
store cannot name the workflow — the resolver hands back the default's vocabulary and the caller
has no way to know it was a guess. Every such site has so far had to keep the legacy ids unioned
in "just in case", which is exactly why the census stalls instead of converging.

With provenance a caller can say what it actually means: trust the resolved columns when the
workflow was SELECTED, and fall back to legacy compat only when it was GUESSED.

Additive by construction — `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` delegates here and drops the provenance, so
no existing caller changes behavior.

  A NAMED SELECTION IS NOT A RESOLVED ONE. `resolveWorkflowIrById` degrades to the default coding
  IR in three further cases — a missing definition, a malformed one, and a throwing lookup — so
  reporting `source: "selection"` merely because the store named an id would hand a caller the
  default's columns wearing the selected workflow's label. That is worse than having no provenance
  at all: the entire value of this API is that a caller can TRUST "selection", and a signal that
  lies is one nobody can build the census conversions on.

  Verified by identity, not by hope: a v2 IR carries its own id, so a returned IR whose id is not
  the selected one is a fallback however it arose. A v1/column-less IR carries no id to check, and
  it has no column vocabulary either, so it is reported as a default rather than guessed at.

  perfectly good selection whose IR simply carries no id of its own — a valid v1, or a stored v2
  that omits it. That direction errs safe (the caller keeps its legacy compat) but it silently
  denies those workflows the very trust this API exists to grant, so the conversion would quietly
  not take effect for them.

  An ABSENT id is no evidence either way, so it is treated as the selection it was asked for. A
  PRESENT id that differs is positive proof of a fallback, and it still catches the three ways
  `resolveWorkflowIrById` degrades — missing definition, malformed definition, throwing lookup —
  because every one of them returns the default coding IR, whose id is `builtin:coding` and
