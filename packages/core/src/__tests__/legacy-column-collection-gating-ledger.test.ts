FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-17:44 (a ratchet over the class the census cannot count):

THE CENSUS SCANS COMPARISONS. THIS CLASS IS COLLECTIONS.

`lifecycle-column-census.mjs` counts `===`/`!==` against a column. A legacy-id Set or array consulted
with `.has(task.column)` is a DEFINITION, not a comparison, so no census run has ever pointed at one.
That blind spot has now produced three found-by-hand defects:

  `GITHUB_TRACKING_EDITABLE_COLUMNS`   the operator could not toggle GitHub tracking at all on a
                                       renamed board — no error, the affordance simply absent (#3149)
  `TIME_INDICATOR_COLUMNS`             cards showed the wrong elapsed-time indicator
  `BLOCKER_ESCALATION_COLUMNS`         escalation skipped renamed lanes

#3149 enumerated the population by hand and reported "19 such sites ... this is where the remaining
renamed-board defects actually live". A number in a PR body rots. This is that enumeration as a
ratchet, so the next one cannot appear silently.

WHAT THIS FILE CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. It claims the POPULATION is the recorded
set. It does NOT claim each site is correct — 20 of the 23 are #3149's assessment ("most are already
correct, either no-flags fallbacks or seed-then-add resolved sets"), and I did not re-verify them.
Blessing sites I have not read is how a ledger becomes a list of things someone once glanced at. A
new entry fails this test and a human reads that ONE site; that is the whole mechanism.

MY OWN DETECTOR'S PICK-WORK LIST WAS 100% FALSE POSITIVES, measured, and it is why this file has no
"unresolved candidates" assertion. The heuristic "no role-helper call in the file" flagged three
sites; all three were fine:

  agent-role-policy.ts:32     a documented FLAGGED-NOT-FIXED deferral with the reasoning recorded
  DocumentsView.tsx:88        already converted — flags-first, threaded as an object rather than
                              called, so a scan for resolver CALLS cannot see the conversion
  agent-assignment.ts:118     a `DELIBERATE-LITERAL` fallback behind an injected
                              `countsAsAssignmentLoad` callback, reviewed 2026-07-31-05:40

That is the same failure `--triage`'s pick-work list had before #3194 fixed it, from the same cause:
inferring "unexamined" from the absence of a pattern rather than from evidence. A detector that
cannot tell "not yet looked at" from "looked at and settled" must not be pointed at a work queue. It
can still hold a population steady, which is all this does.

KNOWN REACH LIMITS, stated so this is not mistaken for coverage of the class:
  - Only NAMED collections (`const X = new Set([...])`) consulted as `X.has(col)`/`X.includes(col)`.
    An inline `["todo","done"].includes(col)` is invisible.
  - The argument must mention column/lane, so `.has(c)` with a short name is missed.
  - Collections reached through a property (`CONFIG.columns.has(...)`) are missed.
  A miss here is a site nobody is watching, not a false green on a site that is listed.
