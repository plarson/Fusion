"Worktrees off" must make `maxWorktrees` genuinely INERT for admission, not merely skipped by
convention. `resolveWorktreeCapacityLimit` is the only expression of that, so the invariant is not
"the resolver is correct" (asserted above) but "nothing bounds admission WITHOUT going through it".

A unit test on the resolver cannot see a second reader. This one enumerates every non-test source
file that uses `maxWorktrees` in a BOUNDING expression — a comparison, a multiplier, a min/max — and
requires each to be named with a reason. A new raw bound fails here rather than quietly re-limiting a
project that turned worktrees off.

MEASURED at the time of writing: exactly two, and only one of them bounds admission.
