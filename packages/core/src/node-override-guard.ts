The async companion to `validateNodeOverrideChange`, which is deliberately synchronous. Lives beside
the guard so the two cannot drift: a caller that resolves lanes some other way would eventually
disagree with what the guard means by "executing" or "completed".

A workflow expressing no trait at all is a v1 upgrade rather than a board without these roles, so it
keeps the legacy ids — as does an unresolvable one. Both are the behaviour the literals already had.

  FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-23:05 (#2821 review — greptile):
  THE LEGACY IDS ARE A FALLBACK, NOT A FLOOR. My first version SEEDED them and then added the
  resolved lanes, so a v2 board that declares `in-progress` or `done` as an ORDINARY untraited column
  still had them treated as wip/complete — blocking a valid mid-flight override in the first and
  refusing a terminal override in the second. A conversion that widens a guard onto columns the board
  says are not those roles is a regression, not a fallback.

  Three states, the same split this program settled on elsewhere:
    resolved + traits expressed -> trust the resolved lanes ALONE.
    resolved + no trait anywhere -> a v1 upgrade (`synthesizeDefaultColumns` emits `traits: []`), so
                                    the legacy ids are the only vocabulary that exists.
    unresolvable                 -> legacy ids; today's behaviour.
