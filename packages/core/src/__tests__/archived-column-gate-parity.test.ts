FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-00:40 (fleet phase — why `async-comments-attachments.ts` was NOT converted):
THE ARCHIVED GATE IS ENFORCED IN THREE ENCODINGS, AND CONVERTING ONE OF THEM IS A SPLIT BRAIN.

Every other file in the column-literal backlog can be converted on its own: resolve the task's
lifecycle columns, compare against the role. `archived` is different, and the difference is not a
matter of degree.

MEASURED on this tree — THREE encodings, 36 sites, all in packages/core:
  - 21 TypeScript comparisons against the literal `"archived"` across 16 files.

  (Was 25 before the renamed-archive producer/consumer conversion. That conversion removed four net
  comparisons, and the guard FAILED until this inventory was updated to match — the ratchet working:
  it notices the TypeScript half moving in either direction, not only up.)
  - 7 Drizzle predicates pushing the same rule into SQL as `ne(tasks.column, 'archived')`, in 6 files.
  - 8 RAW `sql` template comparisons (`sql`${tasks.column} != 'archived'`` and one hand-written
    `SELECT ... "column" = 'archived'`), in 5 files.

I expected two halves and asserted the third was empty. It was not: the raw-template scan came back
with five files on the first run. That is the strongest argument in this file — a partial conversion
does not have to miss one encoding, it can miss two, and nothing in the codebase is counting them.

The SQL halves decide which rows a query RETURNS. The TypeScript half decides what the code does with
a row it already has. All three are encodings of one sentence: "an archived task is not live."

Convert only the TypeScript half and a board whose archived lane is renamed splits:
`getLiveTaskColumn` correctly reports the task archived (it resolved the role), while
`readLiveTaskRows` still hands that task back as live (its SQL still compares the string). A document
write is then rejected by one gate and its parent listed by the other — a state neither gate alone can
produce today, and one that no test would catch, because every builtin workflow spells the column
`archived` so the two halves agree by accident on every board we ship.

WHY THE SQL HALVES CANNOT JUST BE CONVERTED TOO. `ne(tasks.column, ...)` needs the resolved id as a
VALUE at query-build time, so the workflow IR must be resolved BEFORE the query — including inside
`for update` transactions in the document/artifact paths, which currently take no store and no
workflow reader (they receive a `db`/`tx` handle and a task id). Threading a resolver into the
persistence layer, or declaring `archived` a non-renameable system column and marking all 52 sites
deliberate, are both real decisions with real blast radius. Neither is a fleet conversion. The raw
templates are worse again: one of them is a hand-written `SELECT` string, so its comparison is not even
a Drizzle expression that could take a bound value without rewriting the query.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:50 (one wrong reason for picking the cheap option, removed):
The second option looks like it has already been taken — `trait-types.ts` annotates the flag
"RESTRICTED (built-in only)", which reads as "a custom board cannot have its own archive lane". It does
not mean that. The restriction is over trait REGISTRATION: `trait-registry.ts` rejects a NON-BUILTIN
(plugin-defined) trait that declares `archived` or `complete` (R22). A custom WORKFLOW may put the
built-in `archived` trait on a column with any id, and the trait system resolves it — proved in
`archived-lane-is-renameable-today.test.ts`. So option two is a capability REMOVAL that would silently
break any board that has already renamed its archive lane, not the documentation of a constraint that
already exists. That does not decide between the options; it removes a wrong reason for the cheap one.

SO THIS FILE IS THE GUARD, NOT THE FIX. It fails when any of the three encodings stops matching its
audited inventory below — which is exactly what a well-intentioned partial conversion does.

REVERT CHECK, measured. Converting the `archived` comparisons in `async-comments-attachments.ts` (the
shape a conversion PR would produce) drops its audited count from 8 and fails the lockstep case with the
split-brain message. Removing one Drizzle predicate and removing one raw template each fail it from
their own side. All three were run.

  8 -> 5 after #2886, AND THE COUNT MOVED WITHOUT THE BEHAVIOUR MOVING. Read this before trusting it.

  #2886 fixed a real bug (the archived-document guards failed in OPPOSITE directions on a renamed
  lane) by replacing three `column === "archived"` comparisons with `isArchivedLane(column,
  archivedColumns)`. The AST scan counts raw comparisons, so the tally dropped and this file went red
  on main — the ratchet noticing the TypeScript half move, which is what it is for.

  What it is NOT is three sites converted. `archivedColumns` is an OPTIONAL parameter defaulting to
  `LEGACY_ARCHIVED_LANES = new Set(["archived"])`, and MEASURED: no caller anywhere in packages/core
  or packages/engine passes it. Every call therefore resolves to the same literal it replaced, so the
  behaviour is byte-identical and the resolved path is dead code today.

  That matters for the header's split-brain argument above. The danger it describes — the TypeScript
  half resolving the role while the SQL halves still compare the string — is NOT live here, precisely
  because the resolved half is unwired. It becomes live the moment a caller threads real lanes in
  without the SQL sides moving too. The Drizzle and raw-sql inventories are unchanged and still pass.

  So this number now means "5 raw comparisons remain" and NOT "3 sites are done". Wiring
  `archivedColumns` is the unfinished half, and doing it in isolation is the split brain this file
  exists to catch. Flagged on #2886.

                                         two `<> 'archived'` guards AND the `column: "archived"` write
                                         they gate, together — the write is a move TARGET, invisible
                                         to the column census, so converting the guards alone would

                                         anywhere, which carried one of the three.

Recorded rather than argued: this file's own header notes the guard "FAILED until this inventory was
updated to match, which is the ratchet working". It went red on `main` for exactly that reason and
stayed red because neither PR knew this inventory existed — the archived gate is enforced in three
encodings and only the census-visible one announces itself.
