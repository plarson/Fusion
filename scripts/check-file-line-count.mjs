New source files must not be born as god-files. This guard caps new files under
packages/scripts/plugins at MAX_LINES (2000) lines to keep the codebase
splittable and reviewable. The 106 files already over the cap can't be
refactored in one PR, so they are grandfathered through a ratchet baseline
(line-count-baseline.json): each is pinned to its current count and may shrink
but never grow, applying steady downward pressure without blocking unrelated
work. Generated/lock/locale/.d.ts files are out of scope so the guard only
governs hand-written source.

FNXC:CI 2026-06-21-00:30:
FN-6849 re-ratcheted 26 grandfathered ceilings to current counts after organic
feature and test growth, while also tightening three entries that had already
shrunk. Large-file reduction remains the intended long-term direction, but that
work belongs in dedicated follow-up refactors rather than a pretest-unblock
maintenance change.

FNXC:CI 2026-06-21-12:35:
FN-6871 corrects the stale premise that line-count drift blocks `pnpm test`: FN-5048 removed this guard from pretest, so it now runs only through the opt-in `check:line-count` audit. Eleven grandfathered files were re-ratcheted to current counts after small organic feature/test growth; broad shrink/refactor work for these god-files remains the long-term direction and belongs in dedicated follow-up tasks.

FNXC:CI 2026-06-21-23:53:
FN-6917 re-confirms the `pnpm test`-blocking premise is stale because FN-5048 left this guard opt-in under `check:line-count` only. Twenty files were re-ratcheted after organic feature/test growth; `TerminalModal.tsx` was grandfathered after crossing the hard cap as a long-existing file, with focused split follow-up FN-6918. Wholesale god-file shrink/refactor remains the long-term direction and stays deferred to dedicated follow-ups.

FNXC:CI 2026-06-25-00:00:
FN-7013 re-confirms the `pnpm test`-blocking premise is stale: FN-5048 removed this guard from pretest and left it opt-in under `check:line-count` only. Sixty-one current violations were re-ratcheted after organic feature/test growth and eight stale baseline entries were tightened or pruned. `AgentLogViewer.test.tsx` and `merger-ai.ts` were temporarily grandfathered after crossing the hard cap as long-existing files, with focused split follow-ups FN-7028 and FN-7029. Wholesale god-file shrink/refactor remains the long-term direction and stays deferred to dedicated follow-ups.

FNXC:CI 2026-06-25-17:44:
FN-7035 split the two new hard-cap crossers (`ChatView.core.test.tsx` and `notifier.test.ts`) into focused sibling suites rather than grandfathering them. Six existing grandfathered entries were re-ratcheted to current counts after organic test and feature growth; `store.ts` and `types.ts` drift was left out of scope for a follow-up. Wholesale god-file shrink remains long-term deferred work for dedicated refactors.

// Repo-wide guard: hand-written source files may not exceed a hard line-count
// cap (MAX_LINES). This stops the next god-file from being born while leaving
// today's known offenders to be refactored down over time.
//
// Existing oversized files are grandfathered via scripts/line-count-baseline.json,
// which records each file's current line count as its personal ceiling. The
// baseline is a RATCHET: a grandfathered file may shrink (or stay put) but may
// never grow past its recorded count, and once it drops to the cap it is removed
// from the baseline and can never regress. New files get no grandfathering and
// must stay at or under MAX_LINES.
//
// Generated, vendored, and data files are out of scope: only source extensions
// under SCAN_ROOTS are scanned, and *.d.ts is excluded. Lockfiles, CHANGELOG,
// locale JSON, and snapshots never match because of the extension filter.
//
// Run `node scripts/check-file-line-count.mjs --update` to rewrite the baseline
// after an intentional, reviewed change to the set of oversized files.
//
// FNXC:TestInfrastructure 2026-06-21-10:00:
// Line-count drift remains visible through the explicit check:line-count audit,
// but it must not block `pnpm test` from reaching the real test runner. The test
// preflight owns fast safety checks; broad god-file cleanup is tracked separately
// so unrelated task completion is not stuck before tests start.
