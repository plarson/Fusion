FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-00:40 (fleet phase — why `async-comments-attachments.ts` was NOT converted):
THE ARCHIVED GATE IS ENFORCED IN THREE ENCODINGS, AND CONVERTING ONE OF THEM IS A SPLIT BRAIN.

Every other file in the column-literal backlog can be converted on its own: resolve the task's
lifecycle columns, compare against the role. `archived` is different, and the difference is not a
matter of degree.

MEASURED on this tree — THREE encodings, 36 sites, all in packages/core:
  - 21 TypeScript comparisons against the literal `"archived"` across 16 files.

  (Was 25 before the renamed-archive producer/consumer conversion. That conversion removed four net
  comparisons, and the guard FAILED until this inventory was updated to match — the ratchet working:
  it notices the TypeScript half moving in either direction, not only up.)
  - 7 Drizzle predicates pushing the same rule into SQL as `ne(tasks.column, 'archived')`, in 6 files.
  - 8 RAW `sql` template comparisons (`sql`${tasks.column} != 'archived'`` and one hand-written
    `SELECT ... "column" = 'archived'`), in 5 files.

I expected two halves and asserted the third was empty. It was not: the raw-template scan came back
with five files on the first run. That is the strongest argument in this file — a partial conversion
does not have to miss one encoding, it can miss two, and nothing in the codebase is counting them.

The SQL halves decide which rows a query RETURNS. The TypeScript half decides what the code does with
a row it already has. All three are encodings of one sentence: "an archived task is not live."

Convert only the TypeScript half and a board whose archived lane is renamed splits:
`getLiveTaskColumn` correctly reports the task archived (it resolved the role), while
`readLiveTaskRows` still hands that task back as live (its SQL still compares the string). A document
write is then rejected by one gate and its parent listed by the other — a state neither gate alone can
produce today, and one that no test would catch, because every builtin workflow spells the column
`archived` so the two halves agree by accident on every board we ship.

WHY THE SQL HALVES CANNOT JUST BE CONVERTED TOO. `ne(tasks.column, ...)` needs the resolved id as a
VALUE at query-build time, so the workflow IR must be resolved BEFORE the query — including inside
`for update` transactions in the document/artifact paths, which currently take no store and no
workflow reader (they receive a `db`/`tx` handle and a task id). Threading a resolver into the
persistence layer, or declaring `archived` a non-renameable system column and marking all 52 sites
deliberate, are both real decisions with real blast radius. Neither is a fleet conversion. The raw
templates are worse again: one of them is a hand-written `SELECT` string, so its comparison is not even
a Drizzle expression that could take a bound value without rewriting the query.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:59 (THE TS HALF — mostly already converted; the inventory
counts FALLBACK ARMS, which is why 20 reads as 20 outstanding guards and is not):
Sampled the TS inventory the same way. It does not decompose into LANE/STATE the way the SQL half
does, because most entries are not pending conversions at all:

  FALLBACK ARM of an already-converted guard — the literal is reached only when a caller supplies no
  resolved set, and it is the documented degraded answer:
    async-comments-attachments.ts   `archivedColumns ? has(row.column) : row.column === "archived"`
                                    — already marked DELIBERATE-LITERAL / FALLBACK ARM in place.
    update-task-deps.ts:406-408     resolved arm first (`lifecycle?.archived ?? "archived"`), literal
                                    last.
    task-merge.ts:478,489           `if (!columns) return dependency.column === "done" || ...` — the
                                    whole branch is the no-metadata fallback.

  STATE / SENTINEL, not a lane:
    task-id-integrity.ts:444        compares `getLiveTaskColumn`'s MANUFACTURED "archived", which that
                                    function returns for archived OR SOFT-DELETED rows. A normalized
                                    sentinel; resolving it would compare a lane id against a value no
                                    lane produces.
    archive-lifecycle-2.ts:47       `column: "archived"` is a WRITE — it SETS the archive state.

So the TS count overstates outstanding work in the OPPOSITE direction from the SQL count: the SQL half
had two sites that must never be converted, and the TS half has several that are already correct.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE DECISION. "52 sites across three encodings" is the number the gate must keep
in LOCKSTEP, not the number a conversion has to CHANGE. After triage the conversion is the six LANE
Drizzle sites plus whatever small TS remainder is neither a fallback arm nor a sentinel — with the
inventories updated in the same commit so the three encodings stay in step.

That is a materially smaller and better-understood change than the headline implies, and it is now
specified rather than estimated. Still not done here: the gate requires one coordinated commit, and
the remaining judgement is per-site verification of the TS remainder, which wants the owner making the
conversion rather than a third pass of sampling.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:59 (THE TRIAGE, DONE — 8 SQL sites classified with evidence):
The scoping note below says the first question is "which of these are LANE questions and which are
STATE markers?" and that nobody had answered it. Answered here for the Drizzle half, per site, by
reading what each query is FOR. Nothing is converted; this is the input the conversion needs.

LANE (6) — these select or exclude LIVE work, so a renamed archive lane must be resolved:
  store.ts                    revert lookup: ne(archived) + ne(done) picking live revert candidates.
  branch-group-ops.ts:82      near-duplicate marker cleanup over live rows: ne(archived) + ne(done).
  branch-and-pr-entities:438  content-fingerprint duplicate guard, gated on `!includeArchived`.
  branch-and-pr-entities:470  recent sibling lookup: ne(archived) + ne(done).
  async-lifecycle.ts:68       `liveLineageChildFilter` — the name is the classification.
  async-search.ts:82          `liveSearchPredicate(includeArchived)` — same.
  Four of these already hold `store`/`this.asyncLayer`; the two predicate builders need one
  optional parameter each, the shape used throughout this program.

STATE (2) — these are ABOUT the marker `archiveTask` writes, and converting them would be a BUG:
  task-mutation-ops.ts:1072   `cleanupArchivedTasksImpl` selects eq(column,"archived") and then `rm`s
                              each row's files. Widening to the resolved archived set would feed cards
                              merely RESTING in a board's archive lane into a filesystem delete. This
                              is the most destructive site in the family and it looks identical to the
                              LANE ones at a glance — same column, same operator.
  async-self-healing.ts:61    soft-deleted rows whose column DRIFTED from the archive marker
                              (`isNotNull(deletedAt) && ne(column,"archived")`). Resolving it would
                              classify a soft-deleted row sitting in a renamed archive lane as drift
                              and "repair" it.

The raw-SQL half is already partly triaged in place: `async-maintenance.ts` is marked
DELIBERATE-LITERAL as a STATE marker, and `async-archive-lineage.ts`'s soft-delete path writes
`column = 'archived', deleted_at IS NOT NULL` as the storage state it has just set — STATE by
construction.

SO THE SHAPE OF THE WORK: roughly three quarters LANE, one quarter STATE, and the STATE sites are the
ones that destroy data if converted. That is why "convert all three encodings" cannot be done as a
sweep, and why the count alone made it look bigger than it is — the number to convert is smaller than
52, and the number that must NOT be touched is the part worth being careful about.

NOT CONVERTED HERE, and deliberately: the gate requires all three encodings to move together, so a
conversion is one coordinated change with its inventories updated in the same commit. This supplies
the classification that change needs; it does not pre-empt it.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:55 (SCOPING — the choice is not 52-or-nothing):
"Convert all three encodings" and "declare `archived` non-renameable" are the two options offered, and
both sound enormous because 52 sites are counted as one lump. They are not one lump: the sites answer
TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, and only one of them is a lane question.

  LANE:  "is this row resting in the board's archive lane?" — renameable, must resolve.
  STATE: "did Fusion archive this row?" — the marker `archiveTask` writes, NOT renameable.

`async-maintenance.ts` already draws that line and marks its site DELIBERATE-LITERAL: "the STATE
marker here, not a lane... a card merely sitting in a workflow's archived-TRAIT lane is live work and
must not be collected." Converting that site would be a BUG, not progress.

MEASURED, on the SQL half this file calls the hard part — 8 Drizzle sites across 7 files:
  FOUR already have a `store` in scope and could take a resolved set with no signature change:
      branch-group-ops.ts        clearNearDuplicateReferencesToImpl(store, ...)
      branch-and-pr-entities.ts  findRecentTasksByContentFingerprintImpl(store, ...)   [2 sites]
      task-mutation-ops.ts       cleanupArchivedTasksImpl(store)
  FOUR need one parameter each, the optional-lane-set shape used throughout this program:
      async-lifecycle.ts    liveLineageChildFilter(parentId, projectId?)
      async-search.ts       liveSearchPredicate(includeArchived, projectId?)
      async-self-healing.ts listSoftDeletedColumnDriftCandidates(db, ...)
      store.ts              the revert-lookup conditions (already holds `this.asyncLayer`)

That is not "threading a resolver into the persistence layer". It is four call sites that already have
what they need plus four one-parameter widenings — before the triage above removes the STATE sites
from the count. (Two of the four "already have a store" sites turned out to be STATE on inspection;
the triage note above is the authority, this is the reachability survey that preceded it.)

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:50 (one wrong reason for picking the cheap option, removed):
The second option looks like it has already been taken — `trait-types.ts` annotates the flag
"RESTRICTED (built-in only)", which reads as "a custom board cannot have its own archive lane". It does
not mean that. The restriction is over trait REGISTRATION: `trait-registry.ts` rejects a NON-BUILTIN
(plugin-defined) trait that declares `archived` or `complete` (R22). A custom WORKFLOW may put the
built-in `archived` trait on a column with any id, and the trait system resolves it — proved in
`archived-lane-is-renameable-today.test.ts`. So option two is a capability REMOVAL that would silently
break any board that has already renamed its archive lane, not the documentation of a constraint that
already exists. That does not decide between the options; it removes a wrong reason for the cheap one.

SO THIS FILE IS THE GUARD, NOT THE FIX. It fails when any of the three encodings stops matching its
audited inventory below — which is exactly what a well-intentioned partial conversion does.

REVERT CHECK, measured. Converting the `archived` comparisons in `async-comments-attachments.ts` (the
shape a conversion PR would produce) drops its audited count from 8 and fails the lockstep case with the
split-brain message. Removing one Drizzle predicate and removing one raw template each fail it from
their own side. All three were run.

  8 -> 5 after #2886, AND THE COUNT MOVED WITHOUT THE BEHAVIOUR MOVING. Read this before trusting it.

  #2886 fixed a real bug (the archived-document guards failed in OPPOSITE directions on a renamed
  lane) by replacing three `column === "archived"` comparisons with `isArchivedLane(column,
  archivedColumns)`. The AST scan counts raw comparisons, so the tally dropped and this file went red
  on main — the ratchet noticing the TypeScript half move, which is what it is for.

  What it is NOT is three sites converted. `archivedColumns` is an OPTIONAL parameter defaulting to
  `LEGACY_ARCHIVED_LANES = new Set(["archived"])`, and MEASURED: no caller anywhere in packages/core
  or packages/engine passes it. Every call therefore resolves to the same literal it replaced, so the
  behaviour is byte-identical and the resolved path is dead code today.

  That matters for the header's split-brain argument above. The danger it describes — the TypeScript
  half resolving the role while the SQL halves still compare the string — is NOT live here, precisely
  because the resolved half is unwired. It becomes live the moment a caller threads real lanes in
  without the SQL sides moving too. The Drizzle and raw-sql inventories are unchanged and still pass.

  So this number now means "5 raw comparisons remain" and NOT "3 sites are done". Wiring
  `archivedColumns` is the unfinished half, and doing it in isolation is the split brain this file
  exists to catch. Flagged on #2886.
