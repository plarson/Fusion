FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-23:50:
BLOCK NEW INERT CONVERSIONS — an optional trailing lane/flag parameter that no caller supplies.

The lifecycle-column program replaces `column === "done"` with a resolved-role read. A conversion
that adds the parameter and never wires a caller is WORSE than the literal:

  tsc passes        the parameter is optional, so omitting it is legal
  tests pass        the fallback IS the old behaviour — that is what the fallback is for
  the census DROPS  it counts comparisons, and the literal really is gone

So the instrument measuring the program scores the broken version as a win. Measured rate when this
check was written: five of nine conversions in one reviewed-and-green tranche were inert.

WHAT IT CHECKS. Exported functions whose LAST parameter is optional and named like resolved lanes
(`columnFlags`, `lifecycleColumns`, `reviewColumns`, ...). At least one call site must pass that many
arguments. Component props are covered separately by
`packages/dashboard/app/__tests__/resolved-flags-seams-have-suppliers.test.ts`.

LIMITS, STATED SO NOBODY OVER-TRUSTS IT. Call sites are matched by FUNCTION NAME, not by resolved
symbol, so two different functions sharing a name are conflated — `sortTasksForDisplayColumn` exists
in both `core/task-priority.ts` and `dashboard/components/taskSorting.ts` with different signatures,
and a naive reading of this scan sent me to "fix" callers of the wrong one (tsc caught it). Treat a
report as a pointer to investigate, never as a diff to apply. Tests are excluded, so a function called only from tests
reports zero callers — those are allow-listed below, not silently skipped. It proves a caller passes
SOMETHING in that position, not that the value is correct or non-undefined. Cheap half of the
question; it is the half that was silently wrong.

TO CLEAR A FAILURE: wire a supplier, or delete the parameter and leave the literal counted. Adding an
allow-list entry is the last resort and needs the reason spelled out.

test that supplies the argument would clear a seam no production caller supplies — and that is not
hypothetical, it is exactly core's `sortTasksForDisplayColumn`, whose only suppliers ARE its tests.

files containing the omissions it exists to find. It saw only the callers that already pass the
argument, concluded "supplied", and stayed green. That is why this gate did not catch `isTaskStuck`'s
missing suppliers in ListView and Column — review did.

  (effective-model-resolution + a 2-arg private one inside ModelSelectorTab). Both produced false
  reports that cost real investigation, and one nearly produced a wrong "fix" that tsc rejected.

  It can also mask a REAL omission in the other direction: a locally-defined same-named function
  called with more arguments raises the global max and makes an under-supplied seam look supplied.

  So a file that declares its own function with that name has its calls attributed to the local one.

  IMPORTED shadows are handled separately, below — that limitation is now closed.

  Two ways of matching by NAME remain: the one-supplier floor (any single caller passing the argument
  clears the seam, even if ten others omit it) and the test-exclusion (a function exported only for
  tests reads as having no callers, hence the two permanent ALLOWED entries).

  IMPORTED SHADOWS, RESOLVED. `Lane.tsx` imports `sortTasksForDisplayColumn` from `./taskSorting`,

  reports twice — once costing a "fix" tsc rejected, once sending two other batches a list they had
  to audit. Recording the module each callee was imported FROM lets a call be matched to the seam's
  actual declaring file.

  It did not merely silence a false positive. Core's `sortTasksForDisplayColumn` really is unsupplied
  — its third `columnFlags` argument is passed by its own tests and nowhere else — and the dashboard
  function of the same name, called with more arguments from three components, was raising the max
  and reporting the seam as satisfied. So the name collision was hiding a genuine offender behind a
  row everyone had learned to read as noise, which is the worse half of this failure mode: a guard
  that cries wolf trains its readers to skip exactly the line that matters.
