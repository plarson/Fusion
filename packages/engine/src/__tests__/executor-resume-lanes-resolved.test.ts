/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-21:10 (Phase C convergence — resume eligibility):

THE INVARIANT: the columns a paused-node RESUME may start from are the task's own hold, wip and
review lanes.

Four literal comparisons decided that one question and had to agree with each other:
`preservedInReview`, the audit `mode` label, the resume-safety recheck inside the retry callback,
and the branch choosing `execute()` versus `executeWorkflowGraph()`. On a renamed board
`preservedInReview` was false for a card sitting in review AND the recheck rejected it, so the
paused-node re-entry silently never happened — an engine pause/resume left the card parked with
nothing to resume it.

OFF THE `triage` BAR, deliberately: these are `in-review`/`in-progress`/`todo` guards. Same defect
class, different literals; recorded here so the next sweep of that class has a worked example and a
shared resolver to reuse.

  The regression this nearly shipped. A v1 workflow upgraded in place synthesizes its columns with
  `traits: []`, so `resolveLifecycleColumns` returns `{}` and NO lane is declared. A naive
  `wipDeclared = lifecycle?.wip !== undefined` reads that as "this workflow has no implementation
  lane" and the resume router declines — terminalizing every legacy custom workflow's graph-failure
  recovery instead of resuming it.

  Measured, not assumed: parsing a v1 IR yields
  `[{id:"triage",traits:[]},{id:"todo",traits:[]},{id:"in-progress",traits:[]},...]`.

  So `wipDeclared` is TRUE when the IR expresses no lifecycle intent at all, and false only when it
  declares lanes and omits wip — the case in executor-execution-policy-renamed-columns.

FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-19:30 (a MISSED PAIR in resumeOrphaned):
`listWipLaneTasks()` already resolved the wip lane by role, and the filter beneath it did NOT — it
re-asserted the literal `in-progress` on the rows that read returned. So on a renamed board the read
found the orphans and the filter discarded every one.

That is the worse half of this pattern and the reason the sibling structural test was not enough: the
read looks converted, the census scores only the comparison, and the sweep silently does nothing. The
consequence here is that orphaned tasks are NEVER resumed after a crash or restart — the single path
that recovers them — and the failure surfaces only once an operator is already investigating a crash.

`isTaskWorkComplete` is the first thing done per surviving task, before any dispatch, worktree probing
or git, so it is the observable that needs no live registry.

REVERT CHECK, measured: with the filter back on `t.column === "in-progress"`, this fails — the renamed
card is dropped and the sweep returns before touching it.
