/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-15:25 (batch-engine tail — the query-filter gap, made non-theoretical):

THIS TEST PINS A KNOWN DEFECT. It asserts what the engine does TODAY, which is the wrong thing, and it
exists so the defect stops being invisible. See
`docs/solutions/architecture-patterns/self-healing-sweeps-are-blind-on-a-renamed-board.md`.

THE DEFECT. `self-healing.ts` makes 49 calls of the shape
`this.store.listTasks({ column: "<literal>", … })`. `listTasks`' option is `column?: ColumnId` — ONE
literal column, applied as a filter in the store. On a workflow whose lanes are renamed, every one of
those queries returns an EMPTY array, so the sweep it feeds does nothing at all. The sweeps are not
mostly-correct-with-some-unconverted-guards; they never execute.

WHY THIS ASSERTS THE QUERY AND NOT THE OUTCOME. The outcome is the same either way (the sweep returns
0), so an outcome assertion cannot distinguish "did nothing because there was nothing to do" from "did
nothing because it asked the wrong question". The QUERY ARGUMENT is where the defect actually lives, and
it is observable without standing up the git evidence path these sweeps run once they have candidates.

WHY THE SUITE CANNOT SEE IT. Measured across `self-healing*.test.ts`: 30 files define a `listTasks` on
their store fake and 17 IGNORE the `column` option, returning every seeded task regardless of what the
sweep asked for. Those fakes are MORE PERMISSIVE than production, so the sweep under test receives rows
the real query would have filtered out. They prove the sweep's logic while saying nothing about whether
the sweep is ever reached — the mirror image of
`store-fake-defects-that-masquerade-as-production-bugs.md`.

WHEN THE QUERY LAYER IS FIXED this test will fail, because the sweeps will stop asking for the bare
legacy literal. That is the intent — it is a ratchet on a known gap, not an endorsement of it. Rewrite
the expectations against the new query shape at that point and delete this note.

The fix is NOT a literal conversion: `column?: ColumnId` takes one id, and resolution is circular at the
query layer (you need a task to know its workflow, and you are querying to find the tasks). It needs a
multi-column query option plus a resolved union across live workflows — a shared-store-API change across
49 call sites, which is a coordinator-level call.
