FREEZE THE SQL SURFACE — a legacy column id inside a query string is invisible to every other check.

The lifecycle-column census parses TypeScript COMPARISONS. A legacy id inside a SQL string is not a
comparison, it is string data, so the census has never counted these. The inert-seam gate reasons
about parameters and call sites, so it cannot see them either. The surface was uninstrumented.

WHAT IT COST. `cleanupStaleMergeQueueRowsImpl` filtered on `t.column != 'in-review'`. On a board with
a renamed review lane every queued card looked stale, its merge_queue row was deleted, and the card
became unleaseable. Found by the operator reviewing #2819 — in SQL that had already been read past
during that same work, because nothing draws the eye to a literal inside a query.

The analytics group is the quieter half: five sites count `"column" = 'done'`, so on a renamed board
throughput, cycle time, and team dashboards report zero completed work. Nothing errors. Wrong-but-
plausible numbers are the least likely defect for anyone to file.

WHAT THIS DOES. It does NOT fix the existing sites — `resolveProjectColumnsForRoles`
(core/src/project-lane-vocabulary.ts) is the mechanism for that and its migration has an owner (see
issue #2839). This freezes the population so the surface cannot grow while that migration runs: the
baseline records per-file counts, a new file or a higher count fails, and a LOWER count fails too so
the baseline is ratcheted down as sites are migrated rather than silently drifting.

COMMENTS ARE NOT MATCHED, and that is the whole reason this is AST-based. A line-oriented grep for
the same pattern reports 37 hits, 25 of which are prose quoting `column === "done"` in an explanatory
note. A guard with a 68% false-positive rate teaches its readers to skip it, and this repo already
learned that lesson the expensive way. Comments are not AST nodes, so walking string and template
literals cannot match them at all.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-20:20 (#2841 review, second round — greptile P1 "IN predicates
bypass the gate"):

`IN (...)` IS A COMPARISON, AND EACH ELEMENT IS ONE.

The operator list was `=`, `!=`, `<>`, so `"column" IN ('in-progress', 'in-review')` contributed
nothing and a second predicate in that form could be added while the baseline stayed green. It is the
same false-negative class as the pre-filters removed in the first round — a shape the pattern simply
did not describe.

`IS DISTINCT FROM` was a sixth-round finding and a live one: `async-merge-coordination.ts` writes
`${schema.project.tasks.column} IS DISTINCT FROM 'in-review'` — the merge-queue stale sweep, one of
the queries this gate exists to freeze — and the operator list did not contain it, so the predicate
counted zero. `IS`/`IS NOT` are included alongside for the same reason: they are the same comparison
wearing different SQL spelling, and enumerating operators one review round at a time is how the last
five holes happened.

The IN arm counts its LEGACY ELEMENTS, not the predicate: two ids in one list is two vocabulary-bound
sites, the same accounting the `=` arm uses when a query holds two comparisons. The list body is
matched loosely (`[^)]*`) so a mixed list — a legacy id beside a resolved one — is still caught, and
the per-element count is taken from the matched text afterwards.

`[^)]*` STOPS AT THE FIRST `)`, WHICH A NESTED CALL SUPPLIES.

`"column" IN (COALESCE(x, y), 'done')` never reached its legacy id: the leading `[^)]*` halted at
`COALESCE(x, y)`'s closing paren, the id after it was unreachable, and the predicate contributed
nothing. A third false negative of the same family as the first two rounds — a shape the pattern did
not describe — and the reviewer is right that another one could be added with the baseline green.

The IN body now tolerates nested groups TWO levels deep (`LOWER(COALESCE(a, b))` is the realistic
worst case in this codebase). A regex cannot balance arbitrary nesting, and the alternative — matching
the predicate head and extracting the balanced region programmatically — buys a depth nobody writes at
the cost of a second scanner to keep correct. The bound is stated here rather than hidden: at three
levels the gate under-counts again, which is a known limit, not an unknown one.

FNXC:LifecycleColumnCensus 2026-07-30-19:10 (#2841 review — greptile x2 + coderabbit x2, one root cause):

THE PRE-FILTERS WERE THE HOLE, SO THEY ARE GONE.

Four findings arrived against three lines and all reduce to the same mistake: deciding whether to RUN
the comparison regex, using cheaper patterns that disagree with it.

  - A FILE-LEVEL `SQL_SHAPE.test(source)` short-circuit skipped whole files. A file holding only a
    clause fragment (`"column" = 'done'`) has no SELECT/WHERE anywhere, so a new forbidden site could
    be added to it and the gate passed. The exact shape the fragment carve-out below was added for,
    reintroduced one level up.
  - `BARE_CLAUSE` is anchored `^...$`, so a qualified or compound fragment — `t."column" = 'done'`,
    `("column" = 'done' OR active = 1)` — matched neither it nor `SQL_SHAPE`, and the comparison never
    ran.
  - `node.getText()` returns SOURCE text, so a double-quoted TypeScript string spells the identifier
    `\"column\"` with the backslashes intact, and every pattern here expects the decoded `"column"`.

A gate whose false-NEGATIVES are this easy to construct is worse than no gate, because the baseline it
prints reads as coverage. The fix is to stop pre-filtering: run `COMPARISON` — which is already
unanchored and already the definition of a forbidden site — over the DECODED text of every string and
template literal. One pattern, one answer, nothing to disagree with.

THE FALSE-POSITIVE ARGUMENT SURVIVES INTACT, because it never depended on the pre-filters: comments
are not AST nodes, so walking literals cannot match prose no matter how permissive the pattern is.
That is what makes dropping them safe.

`SQL_SHAPE` and `BARE_CLAUSE` are deleted rather than left unused — an unused pattern in a gate is an
invitation to re-add a filter that uses it.

"bracket-access columns evade scanning"):

`schema.project.tasks["column"]` IS THE SAME REFERENCE WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY.

The dot form was the only one matched, so an element-access reference fell through to the NUL
sentinel and its predicate vanished — the identical blindness the static-span join had, reachable by
changing punctuation. Drizzle accepts both spellings and a formatter or a reserved-word column can
produce the bracket one.

Both quote styles and a trailing `!`/`?` are tolerated for the same reason the rest of this scanner
is permissive: the cost of a false positive is one baseline entry, and the cost of a false negative
is a gate that reads as coverage.

The `!` arrived as its own finding (#2841 review, fifth round) because the previous version DOCUMENTED
tolerating it and did not implement it — the comment described the intent and the regex described the
behaviour, and only one of them was executable. A comment that overstates a guard is worse than none:
it is the thing a reader checks instead of the code.
