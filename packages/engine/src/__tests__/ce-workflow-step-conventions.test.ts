/**
 * Compound-Engineering workflow-step skill-loading — focused unit coverage for
 * the plan units U8/U1/U2/U3/U9 engine surface that does NOT require a full
 * executor e2e:
 *
 *   1. The exported `FUSION_WORKFLOW_STEP_CONVENTIONS_PREAMBLE` constant carries
 *      the await-input sentinel grammar, the FUSION_HEADLESS degrade
 *      instruction, and the persona-fan-out / systemPromptOverride /
 *      path-confinement instruction (always feasible — pure constant assertion).
 *
 *   2. Skill resolution: requested CE skill names resolve the named CE skill
 *      once the install dir is fed as a discovery path, whether the request uses
 *      the bare, namespaced, path/SKILL.md-suffixed, mixed-case, or dual form
 *      that executeWorkflowStep merges into requestedSkillNames. This mirrors
 *      and extends compound-engineering-skill-resolution.test.ts, asserting the
 *      normalized U1 request forms resolve once without duplicates.
 *
 * The full runGraphCustomNode -> executeWorkflowStep session path (skillName on
 * the synthesized step, spawn gating, FUSION_HEADLESS, verdict conditional) is
 * covered separately in ce-workflow-step-executor.test.ts (driving the real
 * executor with a mocked agent session).
