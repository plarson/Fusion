/**
 * FNXC:CodeOrganization 2026-08-03-17:05:
 * reviewWorkspacePerRepo peeled from TaskExecutor (U4 Slice B).
 *
 * FNXC:Workspace 2026-06-22-00:30: KTD3 — per-repo review by looping the EXISTING single-cwd reviewStep.
 * The reviewer is an AGENT spawned with `cwd = worktree`, told (in prompt text, reviewer.ts) to run `git diff`
 * itself — it does NOT read a diff passed in code. So per-repo review = ONE reviewer agent per sub-repo. We keep
 * `reviewStep` single-cwd; the CALLERS loop. This helper is the shared loop+aggregate so both review entry points
 * (historically the deleted in-session review tool, now only the step-inversion `stepReview` seam) iterate
 * identically: it invokes the caller's
 * own `invokeForCwd(cwd)` only for an explicitly scoped repository with diff evidence. Acquired
 * worktrees are never task intent: clean scoped repositories are recorded as not-reviewed and
 * out-of-scope worktrees are not opened. Modified in-scope verdicts aggregate as a conjunction.
 * verdict becomes the aggregate verdict (mirroring verifyWorktreeInvariants' first-failing-repo return), and its
 * findings are repo-tagged. A zero-acquire workspace task is classified with the completion invariant: proven
 * commit-free work approves honestly, while unproven work returns non-retryable UNAVAILABLE.
 *
 * Verdict severity for the conjunction: any RETHINK/REVISE/UNAVAILABLE fails the whole review; only all-APPROVE
 * (or all-skipped UNAVAILABLE-advisory, handled by the caller) approves. We surface the first failing repo's exact
 * verdict so the caller's existing verdict→edge mapping (APPROVE done-marking, REVISE block, RETHINK reset,
 * UNAVAILABLE retry) is unchanged.
