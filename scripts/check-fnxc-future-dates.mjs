FNXC STAMPS DATED IN THE FUTURE, FROZEN AT TODAY'S POPULATION.

AGENTS.md requires every FNXC comment to carry a `yyyy-MM-dd-hh:mm` stamp, and nothing checks it. The
only feedback loop is a reviewer noticing, and on 2026-07-30 alone reviewers caught FOUR future-dated
stamps across separate PRs (#2843, #2852, #2856, #2892). Every one was hand-written with nothing to
verify against.

A stamp dated after the change was written is not cosmetic. These comments are the project's record of
WHY code exists, and the census, the solutions docs and several review conventions read them
chronologically — "recorded 2026-07-31" next to a 2026-07-30 commit makes the ordering wrong for
exactly the reader the comment is for.

WHY A BASELINE RATCHET AND NOT A HARD FAIL. 84 source files already carry a future stamp, the furthest
nearly three months out. A gate that fails on all of them is unmergeable and would be turned off, and
mass-editing 84 files to satisfy a new check is churn nobody asked for. So the population is frozen:
a NEW future-dated stamp fails, an existing one does not, and a count that DROPS also fails so a fixed
file cannot leave a slot the surface silently regrows into. Same shape as the SQL column-literal gate.

WHY "FUTURE" AND NOT "MATCHES THE COMMIT DATE". A stamp legitimately predates its commit — work
written Monday and landed Wednesday is normal and correct. Only a date that has not happened yet is
unambiguously wrong, so that is the whole rule; it catches every case a reviewer has caught so far
without inventing a stricter one nobody follows.

THE HOUR WAS NEVER VALIDATED, so `2026-07-30-25:30` passed this gate.

`STAMP` captures only the date, and the future check compares that capture alone — a stamp could
carry any `hh:mm` at all. Four stamps on `main` already read `-24:40` or `-24:00`, and a fifth
`-25:30` arrived with the next PR. AGENTS.md specifies `yyyy-MM-dd-hh:mm`, where `hh` is a clock
hour, and the whole point of the stamp is to make the FNXC record a readable chronology; a time that
cannot exist quietly costs it that.

Counted per file alongside the future-dated population rather than as a separate gate, because it is
the same defect class — a stamp that does not describe a real moment — and one ratchet is cheaper to
keep honest than two.

Today in the repo's LOCAL calendar; a stamp for today is fine, tomorrow is not.

FNXC:FnxcStampHygiene 2026-07-31-03:40 (#2941 review): `toISOString()` is UTC, so for anyone west of
Greenwich it rolls the date forward for part of each day — a stamp written correctly at 5pm in
California read as "tomorrow" and failed the gate. Authors write the local date, so the comparison
has to use the local one.

FNXC:FnxcStampHygiene 2026-08-01-00:10 (five reds in two hours — LOCAL alone is not enough either):
The fleet writes stamps from MANY machines and this gate evaluates them on ONE. #2941 fixed the
author-west-of-the-runner case; the mirror case is an author EAST of it, and that is what broke main
five times in two hours. Measured: three direct-to-main commits landed at 16:12/16:32/16:40 PDT —
23:12/23:32/23:40 UTC on the 31st — carrying stamps of 2026-08-01-00:20/00:50/01:05. Those are
neither the runner's local date nor UTC; they are the AUTHOR's local date in a UTC+1 container. The
gate, running in PDT, called every one of them "tomorrow" and reddened main for every other lane.

So "future" cannot mean "after the runner's calendar". It means after EVERY calendar a correct
author could plausibly be writing from, which is bounded below by the runner's local date and above
by UTC (or vice versa west of Greenwich). Comparing against the LATER of the two accepts both
honest cases and still catches a genuinely invented date — the 2026-08-06 stamp in scheduler.ts,
six days out, fails under this rule exactly as it did before.

This preserves #2941's fix rather than reverting it: west of Greenwich the local date is the earlier
of the pair, so a 5pm-in-California stamp still passes.

clock): A DROP TIGHTENS, IT DOES NOT FAIL.

I copied the drop-fails rule from the SQL ratchet without noticing that this population is not stable
the way that one is. "Is this stamp in the future" is answered against TODAY, so every date boundary
the runner crosses converts some future stamps into past ones and the count falls ON ITS OWN — no code
change involved. With drop-fails that guarantees a red gate on some later day, and it fired within
hours: the baseline was recorded at 2026-07-30 local while CI runs in UTC, already 2026-07-31.

Both sibling ratchets reached the same conclusion for the ordinary reason (the drop is rarely the
failing author's to fix). Here it is stronger still: nobody CAUSED the drop, so there is no author to
fix it. The ceiling follows the count down, says what it lowered, and exits 0; the RISE check — the
actual purpose, "no NEW future-dated stamp" — is untouched and still fails hard.

The rewritten baseline must be committed to take effect; in CI the write is discarded with the runner,
which is why the gate goes green rather than silently banking a stale allowance.

This block used to rewrite the baseline on every plain run. The tightening itself is right — the
comment above explains why banking a stale allowance is worse — but performing it as a SIDE EFFECT of
checking handed every worker an identical uncommitted diff they had not written.

Measured cost: on 2026-07-31/08-01 nine PRs chased three defects in this gate's area, and two of them
(#3283, #3285, five minutes apart, `+0/-1` each) deleted the SAME baseline line. Neither author wrote
it; the gate wrote it, in both of their checkouts, and each reasonably committed what they found. I
also mis-attributed my own dirty tree to leftover work and retracted a measurement partly on that
basis.

So: still computed, still reported loudly, but only WRITTEN under --update-baseline. A plain run is
read-only and stays green — failing on a tightening would redden main every time a stamp simply ages
into the past, which is exactly why the auto-write existed.
