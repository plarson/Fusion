FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-17:05:

THE INVARIANT: the Reliability move counts cover every lane that carries the role, old name and new.

The route issued two queries naming `in-review` and `in-progress`. On a board that renamed either,
both return `{}`, every per-day count is zero, and `inReviewFailureRate7d` divides one zero by
another and reports a healthy rate. A metric that answers with a REASSURING NUMBER instead of an
error is the worst shape this class takes — an operator has no reason to suspect it is blind.

The union covers history as well as the present, which matters because these read MOVE RECORDS: a
board renamed last month has old rows under the old id and new rows under the new one. Asking for
either name alone is what is broken today, not a trade-off between them.

REVERT PROOF, measured: replace the sets with the single literals and the renamed-lane cases fail
with `expected {} to deeply equal { '2026-07-01': 2 }`.

  FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-18:20 (#2861 review — greptile P1):
  A MOVE BETWEEN TWO REVIEW LANES IS NOT AN ENTRY INTO REVIEW.

  A defect the single-lane version could not have. A board with `signoff` and `waiting` both carrying
  review roles has moves between them, and counting by destination alone scores `signoff -> waiting`
  as another entry — inflating the denominator while the bounce count is unchanged, so the headline
  UNDERSTATES the review-failure rate. Wrong in the reassuring direction, which is the failure mode
  this whole change is about; generalising a one-lane query to a set introduced a question one lane
  never had to answer.

  REVERT PROOF, measured: drop the subtraction and this fails with
  `expected { '2026-07-01': 3 } to deeply equal { '2026-07-01': 2 }`.
