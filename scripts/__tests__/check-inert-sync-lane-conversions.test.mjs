// Exit-code coverage for the inert-sync-lane ratchet: a RISE fails, and an unrecorded DROP fails too.
/*
FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-31-23:45:
A RATCHET THAT ONLY TIGHTENS ON REQUEST DOES NOT RATCHET, and nothing tested this one's exit codes.

The rise path was always an error. The DROP path only warned and exited 0, which leaves the
allowance stale-high and the gate slack by exactly the size of the drop.

Measured, and the example is mine: #3065 replaced three
`to === parked.complete || to === parked.archived` guards with `parked.terminal.has(to)` and took the
count 20 -> 18. I did not re-record, nothing failed, and `main` then carried a baseline of 20 against
a real count of 18 — two free slots in the gate whose whole purpose is to stop this class growing.
Two new inert conversions would have passed.

Its sibling `check-lane-wiring.mjs` already exits 1 on an unrecorded drop and says why. These two
gates guard the same program and must not disagree about how seriously they take their own ledger.

Driven by RUNNING the script against a temp baseline, not by importing a helper: the exit code IS the
contract — a version that printed the right warning and still exited 0 would satisfy any assertion
about its output.

DELIBERATELY NOT "the committed baseline matches the tree". That asserts a property of the REPO at a
moment, not of this gate, so it goes red whenever someone else lands an unrecorded change — which is
exactly what happened here: #3114 took `triage.ts` 7 -> 8 and my first version of this file failed for
a reason that has nothing to do with the code under test.

CI already runs the gate itself; a unit test that duplicates that check only adds a second, more
confusing way to learn the same thing. Every case below drives the gate against a baseline it
constructs, so they pass or fail on the gate's behaviour alone.
