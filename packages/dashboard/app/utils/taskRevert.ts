/**
 * FNXC:TaskRevert 2026-07-04-00:00:
 * FN-7524 stamps an AI-undo task with `sourceMetadata.revertOf = <sourceTaskId>`
 * (see `REVERT_OF_METADATA_KEY` in `packages/engine/src/task-revert.ts`) — this is
 * the sole authoritative undo→source pointer written by `createAiUndoTask`. The
 * backend deliberately does NOT set `sourceParentTaskId` for undo tasks (that field
 * is owned by refine/duplicate lineage and child-task counting), so this helper only
 * falls back to `sourceParentTaskId` defensively for forward-compatibility with a
 * future backend shape; today it always resolves via `revertOf`.
 *
 * The `sourceParentTaskId` fallback is gated to `sourceType === "recovery"` (the
 * sourceType `createAiUndoTask` stamps). `task_refine`/`task_duplicate` tasks also
 * set `sourceParentTaskId`, but for an UNRELATED lineage relationship that already
 * renders its own "Created via Refinement/Duplicate of <id>" provenance clause
 * (`getProvenanceLabel` in TaskDetailModal.tsx) — without this gate, an undo-of
 * clause would double-render alongside it for the same id.
 *
 * FN-7555 (this task) surfaces this marker bi-directionally in the dashboard only —
 * no new API, no backend changes. Both `TaskCard` and `TaskDetailModal` import this
 * helper (and `findOpenUndoTaskForSource` below) so the forward/reverse affordances
 * never disagree about what counts as "an undo relationship".

    FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-22:40 (REVERTED — the seam had no supplier):
    STILL A LITERAL, deliberately, and left counted.

    I converted this and added a `columnFlags` parameter — SINCE REMOVED, so this function takes only
    `(tasks, sourceTaskId)` today. Its only caller is TaskDetailModal ~line
    926, which sits ~60 lines ABOVE where `detailColumnFlags` is derived, so it could not supply one.
    The parameter was therefore never passed: the guard was gone, the census counted a conversion,
    and the behaviour was the legacy fallback forever.

    Reverted rather than left as a dead seam. An unsupplied optional parameter is strictly worse than
    the literal — the literal is at least honest, and the census keeps pointing here.

    FNXC:WorkflowResolvedColumns 2026-07-30-20:50 (correcting the unblock recorded above):
    HOISTING THE FLAGS WOULD NOT UNBLOCK THIS — IT WOULD INTRODUCE A WORSE DEFECT.

    The note above says the blocker is hook ordering, i.e. a cost. It is not: it is a correctness
    boundary. This function scans the `tasks` list for OTHER tasks pointing back at the source, so the
    column it classifies belongs to a NEIGHBOUR. `detailColumnFlags` in TaskDetailModal describes the
    MODAL'S OWN task, and its own FNXC note says so explicitly — it is guarded by
    `detailFlagsAreForThisTask` precisely because using it for anything else is wrong.

    So supplying it here would answer "is this neighbour finished?" with the modal task's traits: on a
    project where two workflows reuse a column id, an open undo task would be classified by a workflow
    it does not belong to and the affordance would vanish or persist wrongly. That is the flags-for-
    the-wrong-row shape, and it is worse than the literal because it is wrong on data rather than
    merely stale on vocabulary.

    A CORRECT conversion needs per-NEIGHBOUR flags — the caller would have to resolve each candidate's
    own workflow, which the modal does not have and should not fetch mid-render. Until a per-task lane
    map is available at that call site, the literal is the right answer and the census entry is
    accurate debt rather than a missed conversion.
