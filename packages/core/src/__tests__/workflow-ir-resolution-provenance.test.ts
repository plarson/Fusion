/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-12:30 (lifecycle-column census enabler):

`resolveWorkflowIrForTask` returns the default coding IR in two cases that are NOT the same as
knowing which workflow governs a task: the selection read threw, and the store reported no
selection (the synchronous PostgreSQL path does exactly that). Callers cannot tell a guess from a
real answer, and for lifecycle-column work that difference decides correctness.

Concretely: post-merge the default coding lineage declares `todo` as its single Planning column
and NO `triage`. A call site converting a `column === "triage"` guard to trait resolution
therefore stops firing for `builtin:legacy-coding` cards whenever the store cannot name the
workflow — it silently gets the default's vocabulary. Every site converted so far has had to keep
the legacy ids unioned "just in case", which is why the census stalls rather than converging.

These pin the three answers a caller needs to distinguish, and that the existing function's
behaviour is untouched.

selection is not resolving it, and reporting "selection" for any of these hands the caller the
default's columns wearing the selected workflow's label. A provenance signal that lies is worse
