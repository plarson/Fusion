FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-30-08:20 (Phase C convergence — default-workflow-hooks.ts):

THE INVARIANT: a reopen is "live work (wip/review/complete) back into a planning lane
(intake/hold)", decided from the moving task's OWN workflow — not from the default
lineage's column names.

WHY THIS IS A SAFETY TEST AND NOT A TIDYING TEST. `default-workflow-hooks.ts` is named
for the default workflow but the store runs it on the flag-ON path for EVERY workflow
(the trait registry resolves each hook by trait id, not by workflow). Its reopen
predicates were lists of the default lineage's names, so on a renamed board every reopen
effect silently did nothing. One of those effects clears `workflowStepResults`, and
`getTaskMergeBlocker` reads exactly that: a card bounced out of review kept its OLD
review results, and a `passed` result satisfies the merge gate. So a renamed workflow
could merge with its re-review never run — the same regression the graph-owned-crossing
carve-out in `applyReopenFieldClears` exists to prevent, arriving through the other door.

The `todo`/`triage` names are the thing being removed here, which is why this file is
part of the triage-guard convergence and not a separate refactor: `default-workflow-hooks.ts`
held 4 of them and `moves.ts`'s flag-ON mirror held 1 more.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CONVERTED: the flag-OFF inline block in `moves.ts` (~line 867).
That branch IS the legacy path and is kept verbatim on purpose so the two paths can be
parity-checked; converting it would erase the reference implementation.
