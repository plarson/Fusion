FNXC:WorktreeCapacity 2026-08-01-00:50:
THE WORKTREE-CAPACITY ARITHMETIC — the numbers behind two live defects, previously unpinned.

#3262 pinned the terminal PREDICATE and said plainly what it did not cover: blinding that predicate
to `false` leaves all 22 scheduler suites green, because the arithmetic it feeds had no behavioural
coverage at all. This is that gap.

Both observed failures live in these few lines, and they fail in OPPOSITE directions:

  UNDER-COUNT admits work over the cap. The commit that added this gate reports maxWorktrees=4 with
  four planning sessions each holding a worktree, and a replan dispatch admitted as the FIFTH,
  because the ledger counted WIP cards only and never learned to count planners.

  OVER-COUNT self-deadlocks. A planned Ready card RETAINS its planning worktree for execution reuse,
  so counting it as a holder blocks its own release — 2 wip + 3 idle-held = 5/4, and the first
  unpause released only 2 of 4 slots' worth of work.

Asymmetry is why both are pinned: under-counting breaks the cap and lets real work over it;
over-counting only starves dispatch. A test that covered the "safe" direction alone would leave the
expensive one open.

WHY THE PREDICATE IS INJECTED rather than resolved here: the holder set's job is the SET ARITHMETIC —
who is excluded and how the total is formed. Which lanes are terminal is #3262's test, and resolving
it here would make this file fail for that reason instead of this one.
