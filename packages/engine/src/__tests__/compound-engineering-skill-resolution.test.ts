/**
 * U2 — Empirical proof of how Compound Engineering bundled skills become
 * resolvable in an agent session.
 *
 * This drives the REAL engine skill pipeline:
 *   pi-coding-agent `loadSkills` (disk discovery)  →
 *   `resolveSessionSkills` + `createSkillsOverrideFromSelection` (the same
 *   path `createFnAgent` uses in pi.ts via DefaultResourceLoader.skillsOverride).
 *
 * THE QUESTION: does declaring `skills: PluginSkillContribution[]` (whose
 * contribution surfaces only as a *name* in `requestedSkillNames`) make a
 * bundled SKILL.md resolvable, OR is a physical install into a discoverable
 * directory also required?
 *
 * ANSWER (asserted below): the contribution alone is NOT enough. The engine
 * never ingests `PluginSkillContribution.skillFiles` into the discovered set;
 * the requested name has nothing on disk to match. A physical, plugin-local
 * install (so the SKILL.md lives on a path `loadSkills` scans) is REQUIRED.
 *
 * The test is self-contained on the engine side: it models "a physical install"
 * by materializing a `ce-plan/SKILL.md` on disk and pointing disk discovery at
 * its parent dir — exactly what the plugin's `installBundledCeSkills` does into
 * a plugin-local directory wired through `additionalSkillPaths`. (The plugin's
 * own cpSync + isolation behavior is verified in the plugin package's
 * skill-installation.test.ts; the engine package cannot import plugin source
 * without violating its tsc rootDir.)
